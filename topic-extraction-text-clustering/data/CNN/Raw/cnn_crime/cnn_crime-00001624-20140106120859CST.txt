(CNN) -- Colleen LaRose, known as "Jihad Jane," was sentenced Monday to 10 years in prison, a clerk for the judge in the case said.
Judge Petrese B. Tucker included the four years LaRose has already been in jail, meaning she has six left to serve.
Authorities say LaRose called herself "Jihad Jane" on YouTube. In 2009, she was indicted on four counts, including conspiring to support terrorists and kill someone overseas. She was allegedly part of a plot to murder Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks, who outraged some by depicting the prophet Mohammed with the body of a dog in 2007.
