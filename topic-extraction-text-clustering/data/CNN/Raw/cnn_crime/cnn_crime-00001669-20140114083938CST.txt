(CNN) -- The U.S. Department of Justice announced on Monday it would provide a grant of nearly $8.4 million to organizations providing support to victims, witnesses and first responders involved in the events surrounding the Boston Marathon bombings in April 2013.
"With this grant, we reaffirm the Justice Department's firm commitment to standing with the victims of this heinous crime -- and all of the community leaders and service providers who continue to heal this remarkable and resilient city," said U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder in a news release.
The funding will cover "costs, both incurred and anticipated, for organizations providing crisis intervention services and trauma-informed care, continuum of care, socioeconomic support, wrap-around legal services and other victim assistance," according to the release.
On April 15, 2013, two pressure-cooker bombs were detonated near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three and injuring at least 264 more.
"This award will ensure that Boston and the state of Massachusetts can provide critical support to victims and their families as they work to restore a sense of normalcy to their lives," the release said.
