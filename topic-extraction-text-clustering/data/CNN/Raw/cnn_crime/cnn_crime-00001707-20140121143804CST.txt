(CNN) -- Three months after his mother's desperate plea for a missing autistic teen to "walk toward the lights" was blasted through the streets of New York by police patrol car loudspeakers, DNA tests confirmed Avonte Oquendo is dead.
Human remains found in New York last week match DNA provided by Vanessa Fontaine, the 14-year-old boy's mother, the spokeswoman for the city Office of the Chief Medical Examiner said Tuesday.
Police on Thursday found legs and an arm next to the East River in Queens, as well as size 5Â½ Air Jordan sneakers that match Avonte's shoes, the teen's family attorney, David Perecman, said on Friday. Investigators also found size 16 dark jeans, the same size Avonte wore, and underwear, the lawyer said.
Fontaine, who kept up hope that she would find her son alive, provided the DNA sample police used to verify they had found the child's remains.
After he had been missing for three weeks, she addressed reporters at an October 25 news conference.
"My thoughts are that my son is still out there, and I want everyone to continue to help me search for my son," Fontaine said. "He is not gone."
In the search for Avonte, police deployed sniffer dogs, combed surveillance footage, searched the sewer system, put up posters, and filled the streets with fliers. There were alerts on the New York subway and messages in local newspapers. Divers used sonar to explore the city's waterways.
Avonte, who had the mental capacity of a 7- or 8-year-old, was supposed to be with a monitor at all times, Fontaine said. But surveillance footage that captured her son bounding out of Center Boulevard School on Long Island at 12:38 p.m on October 4 did not show him with a supervisor.
"He doesn't know that, you know, 'I can get hurt in the street, someone can grab me and take me,'" his mother said. "He doesn't know that. He doesn't know fear."
New York police patrol cars and search vehicles played a recording of Avonte's mother calling for him into the streets, Keith Brooks, director of operations for CityWide Disaster Service, said in October.
"Avonte, this is your mother. You are safe. Walk toward the lights," the message repeated.
The hope was that the teen, who could not communicate verbally, would hear the sound of his mother's voice and approach the emergency vehicles.
