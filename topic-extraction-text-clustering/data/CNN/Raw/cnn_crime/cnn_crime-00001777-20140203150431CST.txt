(CNN) -- A high-profile trial is set to begin in Florida on Monday involving a man who fatally shot a 17-year-old African-American teenager.
The man claimed he shot in self defense. But authorities found no guns in the car the teen was riding in.
The case is garnering international attention not just because of the similarities to the case of Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman, but also because the prosecutor in the case is the same: State Attorney Angela Corey.
Michael Dunn shot and killed Jordan Davis, 17, in November 2012.
Dunn told police that he asked Davis and three other teens, who were parked next to him at a Jacksonville gas station, to turn down their music. Dunn said he heard threats from the teens and saw a gun in their car.
He said he feared for his safety, and that's why he grabbed his gun and fired into the vehicle.
Police say that they found no guns inside the teens' vehicle and that Dunn fired his gun eight or nine times.
Dunn has been charged with first-degree murder in Davis' death and also faces three counts of attempted first-degree murder for shooting at the three others in the vehicle. He has pleaded not guilty.
Dunn's attorney, Robin Lemonidis, has told CNN that her client was reacting to what he said was a gun being drawn.
"When all the evidence has been flushed out, I believe that it will be extremely clear that Mr. Dunn acted as any responsible firearm owner would have under the same circumstances," Lemonidis said.
