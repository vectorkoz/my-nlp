(CNN) -- A man posted a video of a motorcyclist weaving through Texas traffic at breakneck speeds, with a daring caption: "catch me if you can."
And police say they plan to do exactly that.
In the video posted on Facebook, the motorcyclist dangerously cuts through rush hour traffic in San Antonio at speeds of more than 100 mph, according to authorities.
His helmet camera records every hair-raising moment as he squeezes between cars and trucks.
Someone posted the video on the San Antonio Police Department's Facebook page, catching their attention.
"Really all it would have taken was a split second for him to impact the lives of several people, possibly killing someone just by his very actions," said Sgt. Javier Salazar.
Police Chief William McManus says the motorcyclist is believed to be Alberto Rodriguez, 27. It's unclear when the video was taken, but he posted it on his page and someone later reposted it on the Police Department's page.
In addition to the motorcycle incident, police said Rodriguez is wanted on two outstanding felony warrants and one misdemeanor for family violence, CNN affiliate KSAT reported.
Authorities said they have his personal information, and detectives are looking for him.
"So if Mr. Rodriguez is watching, he might as well turn himself in because it's only a matter of time before we catch you," McManus said.
The motorcyclist faces a reckless driving charge, a possible fine of $200 and 30 days in jail.
In a cyber twist, San Antonio authorities are using the same platform as the speeding motorcyclist.
They've posted a video asking for tips on their Facebook page.
