(CNN) -- Actor Sam Worthington, best known for his leading role in the 2009 blockbuster "Avatar," was arrested Sunday after getting into an altercation with a photographer, New York City police said.
Worthington is accused of punching photographer Sheng Li in the face after Li allegedly kicked Worthington's 26-year-old female companion in the shins, according to NYPD Detective Kellyann Ort.
The department would not release the name of Worthington's companion.
The incident occurred at 5:30 p.m. Sunday in Greenwich Village.
Worthington was issued a desk appearance ticket and was released, according to Ort. Li, a 37-year-old photographer who lives in Manhattan, was held for arraignment. He does not have press credentials.
No one was hospitalized, Ort said.
Worthington was born in England but moved to Australia, where he was raised and began his acting career.
In addition to Avatar, Worthington has also acted in "Terminator Salvation" (2009), "Clash of the Titans" (2010) and "Man on a Ledge" (2012).
He was named "GQ Man of the Year" in Australia in 2009.
