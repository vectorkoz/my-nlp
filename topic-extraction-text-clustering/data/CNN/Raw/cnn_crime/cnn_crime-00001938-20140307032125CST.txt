(CNN) -- Aaron Hernandez, who already faces first-degree murder and weapons charges, could face even more trouble after a jailhouse fight last week.
The Bristol County, Massachusetts, sheriff is asking that the former New England Patriots star face a simple assault-and-battery charge for allegedly punching a fellow inmate.
Neither man was seriously injured.
Sheriff Thomas Hodgson told CNN on Thursday the charge would be a misdemeanor.
Hodgson said he filed a criminal complaint application with the Third District Court. Hernandez, 24, is aware of the filing, he said.
The case is now in the hands of the district magistrate, who will decide whether there is probable cause for a charge to move forward. If so, an arraignment will follow, Hodgson told CNN.
An attorney for Hernandez did not immediately respond Thursday to a CNN message. Attorneys have not responded to questions about the February 25 fight involving an unidentified inmate.
Hodgson last month said that jail officials will be looking at how the two inmates came into contact, because "no more than one inmate is supposed to be out at a time" in the unit where Hernandez is housed.
Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to the murder charge.
Authorities have said that Hernandez and two other men picked up Odin Lloyd from his Boston apartment in a rental car shortly before Lloyd was found shot to death on June 17.
Surveillance cameras then captured the rental car leaving the crime scene and Hernandez carrying a gun as he returned to his home minutes later, according to authorities.
CNN's Chris Boyette and Rande Iaboni contributed to this report.
