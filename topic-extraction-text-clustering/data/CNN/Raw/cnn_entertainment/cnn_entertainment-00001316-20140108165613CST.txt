Washington (CNN) -- Singer Chris Brown appeared before a Washington, D.C. judge Wednesday along with his bodyguard Christopher Hollosy, facing misdemeanor assault charges stemming from an incident outside the W hotel in October 2013.
Brown and Hollosy were offered plea deals which would charge each of them with only one count of misdemeanor assault. But since video surveillance from the incident still hasn't been entered into evidence, and Brown's bodyguard is only facing one count of assault to begin with, lawyers for Brown and Hollosy said they are rejecting the current plea deal at this time.
Both sides agreed to meet again on February 20. That would give both legal teams ample time to review the evidence once it is available and negotiate a possible plea deal.
Brown's lawyers have requested a waiver of appearance for him for the February court date, citing the singer's current enrollment in rehab for anger management. To appear in court would cause Brown to miss up to three days of treatment, his lawyers argued, delaying his completion of the program.
Brown faces 180 days in jail and a fine of up to $1000 if convicted in Washington, but the singer's real legal troubles are in California. Brown has been on probation for charges stemming from 2009, when he brutally attacked his then-girlfriend Rihanna.
A judge in California recently revoked Brown's probation, but since Brown was already in a treatment program for anger management and completing his community service requirements, it had limited immediate effect.
The charges being brought against Brown in Washington could influence the judge's decision on whether or not the R&B sensation has to serve jail time once he completes his rehabilitation.
His next court date in California is set for February 10, presumably before his legal woes in Washington will be settled.
