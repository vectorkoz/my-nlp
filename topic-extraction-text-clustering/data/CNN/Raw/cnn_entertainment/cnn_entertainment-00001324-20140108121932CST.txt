(CNN) -- The Director's Guild of America has announced its feature film nominees for 2014, and you can probably guess who made the cut.
The DGA's list of five names is perfectly in sync with the handful of films that have been championed as top awards season contenders, from "American Hustle" to "12 Years A Slave."
So yes, Steve McQueen (who helmed "12 Years") and David O. Russell ("Hustle") are up for the honor of outstanding directorial achievement in 2013, along with Martin Scorsese ("The Wolf of Wall Street") and Alfonso Cuar√≥n ("Gravity").
Although Spike Jonze's "Her" has enjoyed exuberant praise from critics, he didn't make it into this group of nominees. The final director rounding out the DGA's list is Paul Greengrass, who led Tom Hanks' lauded adaptation, "Captain Phillips."
"To be chosen by your peers in a year full of incredibly well-crafted films is the true marker of outstanding directorial achievement," said DGA President Paris Barclay, as he announced the nominees. "The passion and vision of each of the nominees resulted in tremendously diverse films that kept audiences mesmerized. Congratulations to each of the nominees on a job very well done."
The winner of the DGA award for achievement in feature film will be announced at the organization's 66th annual awards ceremony on January 25. "Glee" star Jane Lynch will host the event, which will be held in Los Angeles.
