(CNN) -- We love it when an awesome rumor turns out to be true.
As suspected, OutKast will indeed reunite at Coachella 2014, headlining the three-day music festival in Indio, California, along with Muse and Arcade Fire.
The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival will be a must-see for OutKast fans, who've been anxiously waiting for Big Boi and Andre 3000 to begin performing as a duo again.
The two artists have spent the past several years largely working on solo projects, with hints of an eventual reconnection surfacing regularly. In November, speculation grew that the two would choose Coachella for their big reunion, but it wasn't until Wednesday night that the festival confirmed the news.
Joining OutKast, Arcade Fire and Muse will be a number of newer faces, such as Lorde and Haim, plus established artists such as Nas, Motorhead and Pharrell.
Coachella will run the same lineup across two weekends in April: the first edition is scheduled for April 11-13, followed by the second stretch from April 18-20.
OutKast will kick off Coachella with acts such as the Replacements, Zedd, Girl Talk, Ellie Goulding and Haim, with Muse leading the second day along with Lorde, Foster the People, Pet Shop Boys, Queens of the Stone Age, Skrillex and Sleigh Bells.
Closing out the event on both weekends will be Arcade Fire, Beck, Calvin Harris, Disclosure, Lana Del Rey, Chance the Rapper and more.
Tickets will go on sale at 7 a.m. ET (10 a.m. PT) Friday. Coachella's website says the best chance to score access is by registering for the second weekend.
