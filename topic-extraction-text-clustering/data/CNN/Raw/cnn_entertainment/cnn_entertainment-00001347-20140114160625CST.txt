Los Angeles (CNN) -- Justin Bieber got some unexpected visitors Tuesday morning: sheriff's deputies with a warrant to search his home.
Investigators with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department were looking for video from Bieber's security cameras that might show what happened Thursday night when eggs were thrown at a neighbor's home, according to a sheriff's statement.
A judge gave deputies a felony search warrant, which they carried out Tuesday morning, the sheriff's statement said.
Bieber was at home when deputies arrived, and he talked to investigators, according to Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. Dave Thompson. He was cooperative with the dozen deputies, but he did not answer questions about the alleged vandalism, Thompson said.
Justin Bieber's bad year: A guide
Bieber hasn't spoken to investigators about last week's incident, and his representative had declined comment to CNN.
One of Bieber's house guests was arrested when deputies allegedly found cocaine during their search, Thompson said.
The drug suspect was not immediately identified because "I was told he gave us a bad name," sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore told CNN on Tuesday afternoon. Detectives were running the man's fingerprints before publicly naming him, an official said.
"The purpose of the search warrant is to seek video surveillance or other possible evidence in the vandalism that occurred on January 9, 2014," the sheriff's statement said..
The vandalism damage to the house of Bieber's neighbor was about $20,000, Thompson said. The cost of repairing the damage to the house is a key factor in determining the severity of the charge. Any damage of more than $950 would qualify the charge as a felony.
"A neighbor accused him of throwing eggs at the house, and we are investigating," Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Don Prince told CNN on Monday.
If investigators find enough evidence that Bieber, 19, threw the eggs that splattered against his next-door neighbor's home, they could refer the matter to the district attorney's office for possible prosecution, Prince said.
Bieber's Brazil adventures: Truth or idol gossip?
Bieber lives in the Oaks, an exclusive gated community, in Calabasas. He moved into a $6.5 million mansion there two years ago. An impressive list of the rich and famous -- including Michael Jackson's mother and children -- live in the neighborhood, about 30 miles west of downtown Los Angeles.
His neighbors have complained about Bieber several times in the past year, including in May when two neighbors called the sheriff to report he was speeding down residential streets, a sheriff's spokesman said.
Deputies visited Bieber's home in response, but the singer refused to talk to them, Sheriff's Department spokesman Steve Whitmore said.
Retired NFL star Keyshawn Johnson went to Bieber's home then to counsel him about the dangers of going too fast on the residential streets, but Bieber wouldn't speak to him, Johnson's rep told CNN in May.
A neighbor accused Bieber of spitting on him and making threats during a heated confrontation outside his home last March, Whitmore said. It prompted a sheriff's probe, but no charges followed.
