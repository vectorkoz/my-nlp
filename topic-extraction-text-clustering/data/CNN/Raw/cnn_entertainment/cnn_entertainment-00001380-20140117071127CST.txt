Los Angeles (CNN) -- Former Playboy centerfold Cassandra Lynn Hensley was found dead at a friend's home in Los Angeles, the coroner said Friday.
Hensley was 34.
The autopsy on Playboy's Miss February 2006 was done Thursday, but the determination of the cause of death has been deferred until toxicology testing is completed, Los Angeles County coroner's Lt. Joe Bale said. Lab results usually take several weeks to become available.
The model's body was found at 9 a.m. Wednesday in a home in the Marina Del Rey area, Bale said.
Hensley, who lived in Fairfax, Virginia, told Philadelphia's Metropolis Nights magazine last month that there was "life after Playboy."
"I have been a part of many great experiences: travel shows, magazine covers, and of course giving advice to young impressionable girls who think they need to act a certain way for a chance to be a model -- classy not slutty," she told the magazine.
