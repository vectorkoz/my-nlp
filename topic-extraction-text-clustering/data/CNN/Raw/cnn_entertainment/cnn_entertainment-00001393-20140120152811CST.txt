(CNN) -- In less than a month, Jay Leno will pass the "Tonight Show" torch to Jimmy Fallon.
But before he does, Leno will have him on as a special guest.
NBC has confirmed that Fallon will have a seat on Leno's "Tonight Show" couch on February 3, which will kickoff Leno's final week. Matthew McConaughey, Charles Barkley, Sandra Bullock and Betty White are also scheduled to stop by to help Leno bid adieu to his 22-year run.
On February 6, Leno's final night, he'll be joined by his first-ever "Tonight Show" guest, Billy Crystal.
The iconic program will then pick up and move across the country back to its old home in New York City, with Fallon preparing to become its new host on February 17. Will Smith has been lined up as Fallon's first guest, with U2 slated to perform.
And after Fallon settles in at "Tonight," another "Saturday Night Live" star, Seth Meyers, will take over hosting duties for "Late Night." His debut will be on February 24 with former "SNL" alum and "Parks and Recreation" star Amy Poehler as his first guest.
Meyers' last night at "SNL" will be February 1.
