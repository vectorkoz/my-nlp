(CNN) -- The 56th Annual Grammy Awards will certainly have its share of winners, whether it be Daft Punk, Jay Z or Macklemore & Ryan Lewis.
But it's also going to have something even bigger: a mass wedding.
Yes, during the performance of Macklemore & Lewis' "Same Love" -- a song written in support of same-sex marriage -- the stage of Los Angeles' Staples Center is going to be filled with 34 couples there to tie the knot. Queen Latifah will officiate, and Madonna will serve as maid of honor. (If she wanted to, she could bring her own wedding dress.)
The Grammys are often about such outlandish and talked-about moments. Think about Elton John's duet of "Stan" with Eminem -- which was a retort to criticism of Eminem's homophobic lyrics -- or Lady Gaga's jump into a celebrity meat grinder. It's almost enough to turn the honors themselves into background noise.
But this year's nominations feature a wide range of styles and artists, particularly among the big three awards of album, song and record of the year. The latter category includes Daft Punk's "Get Lucky" and Robin Thicke's "Blurred Lines," two songs that dueled it out for song of the summer, as well as Lorde's "Royals," which became an anti-materialist anthem for some fans.
Jay Z leads Grammy nominations
Other record of the year nominees include Bruno Mars' "Locked Out of Heaven" and Imagine Dragons' "Radioactive."
Macklemore & Ryan, who had a big year thanks to "Same Love" and "Thrift Shop," are up for album of the year for "The Heist," song of the year (a songwriters' award) for "Same Love" and best new artist. The duo is up for seven Grammys total.
"Seven is unbelievable," Lewis told CNN in December. "We came here hoping for one."
Jay Z led all nominees with nine nods, though he's competing against himself in some categories. Like Macklemore & Lewis, Justin Timberlake is also up for seven Grammys, though he is unexpectedly absent from album of the year (for "The 20/20 Experience").
There are more than 80 Grammy categories, so most awards are given out before the show. Macklemore & Lewis were among the early winners, taking home three Grammys: rap album ("The Heist"), rap performance and rap song (both for "Thrift Shop").
Adele, a big winner two years ago, won yet another Grammy, this time for her "Skyfall" theme song. Other winners include Ziggy Marley (reggae album); Stephen Colbert (spoken word); and Terri Lyne Carrington (jazz instrumental album).
Daft Punk has won at least two early Grammys for its album "Random Access Memories," one for its engineering, the other in the dance electronic category. Neither of the robot-dressed duo attended the preshow apparently.
Performers for the show are diverse. They include Fleetwood Mac's Lindsey Buckingham; Nine Inch Nails; John Legend; Katy Perry; and a quartet featuring Merle Haggard, Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson and Blake Shelton. Former Beatles Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr are also scheduled to perform.
The Beatles are among those given Lifetime Achievement Awards by the Recording Academy, which oversees the Grammys.
The show will be hosted by LL Cool J and air on CBS starting at 8 p.m. ET.
