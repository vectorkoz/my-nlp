(CNN) -- We may finally be able to put this whole "twerking" thing to rest.
Though it's been around for years, it wasn't firmly a part of the Zeitgeist until Miley Cyrus unleashed it upon the world. So we can probably thank Cyrus for a video of 68-year-old Helen Mirren twerking.
Yes, you read that right.
Dame Helen Mirren, Oscar winner, star of stage and screen and one of the most venerable actresses of our time, apparently doesn't mind dropping it like it's hot.
On Thursday, Mirren was honored at Harvard University with the Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year award. The Hasty Pudding group is the oldest undergraduate drama troupe in the U.S. Every year, it salutes -- and mocks -- performers who have made a lasting and impressive contribution to the entertainment industry.
During the ceremonies to honor her, Mirren was presented with the task of twerking, and so she did. She later admitted that it was not her first twerk.
"I've tried in my bedroom in private in front of the mirror, very unsuccessfully," she said. "Absolutely humiliating to have to do it in public in front of a whole load of people."
Twerk on, Helen Mirren. Twerk on.
