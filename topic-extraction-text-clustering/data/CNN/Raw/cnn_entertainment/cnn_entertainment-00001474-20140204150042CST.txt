(CNN) -- Katy Perry is officially the queen of Twitter.
The singer has reached more than 50 million followers on the social media site, making her the most followed person in the universe.
Perry took the milestone in stride. "Oh yeah AND we grew to 50 million Katycats! Eh, regular day at the office," she tweeted (of course).
Not that Perry doesn't have competition hot on her heels.
Justin Bieber has about 49.4 million "beliebers" hanging on his every 140-character submission, while President Barack Obama has around 41.2 million followers. Lady Gaga has just over 41 million "little monsters."
The video site YouTube, Taylor Swift, Britney Spears, Rihanna, Instagram, and Justin Timberlake round out the rest of the top 10 most-followed Twitter accounts.
Perry snagged the Twitter throne from Bieber in November. He, in turn, had earlier toppled Gaga, who for two years was the most followed person. In October she told USA Today that felt felt like she had "learned how to tame that social media dragon."
