(CNN) -- In the 22 years that Jay Leno has been the host of the "Tonight Show" -- give or take the spare months Conan O'Brien took the helm -- O.J. Simpson was the celebrity most often used as the butt of Leno's jokes.
The TV veteran took aim at politicians and celebrities with equal zeal, landing family friendly barbs about Lindsay Lohan alongside wisecracks about Al Gore. (Interestingly enough, former President Bill Clinton was the biggest Leno target of all.)
But on Thursday, Leno will have to say his final quips as he departs "Tonight." As we reminisce about his comic talents, we took a look at the stars he most frequently joked about, which you can see listed below.
Although the joke is occasionally on Leno in the press, the 63-year-old's late-night colleague, Jimmy Kimmel, makes a great point with his goodbye tweet.
"Issues aside, 20 years at #1 is a remarkable achievement," Kimmel posted Thursday. "Congratulations and best wishes to @jayleno on an incredible run."
At least Leno can know that after all the drama he's had in his position, he's going out on top. Relive some of his best moments in the video below.
Tune in to the "Tonight Show" on February 17 to see the newest host, Jimmy Fallon, take over.
