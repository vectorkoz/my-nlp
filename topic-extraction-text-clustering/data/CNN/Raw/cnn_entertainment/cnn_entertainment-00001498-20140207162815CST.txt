Washington (CNN) -- The Federal Aviation Administration said Friday that it is looking into allegations that passengers on board singer Justin Bieber's charter flight last week interfered with the flight crew.
Under FAA regulations, "No person may assault, threaten, intimidate, or interfere with a crew member in the performance of the crew member's duties aboard an aircraft."
Earlier this week, sources told CNN that Bieber and his father were "extremely abusive verbally" to a flight attendant on the chartered Gulfstream IV aircraft that landed at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey last Friday.
According to a report by U.S. Customs and Border Protection read to CNN, passengers ignored repeated requests by the crew to put out marijuana cigarettes on the flight from Ontario to Teterboro.
The pilots asked the flight attendant to remain in the cockpit to protect her from the alleged abusive behavior, the report says.
Law enforcement sources told CNN that the pilots donned oxygen masks to keep them from inhaling the pot smoke.
No illegal substances were found during a search by dog-sniffing drugs, a law enforcement source told CNN last week.
In a statement to CNN on Friday, the FAA said it is "looking into allegations" that passengers on the plane interfered with the flight crew, but it did not identify specific passengers.
