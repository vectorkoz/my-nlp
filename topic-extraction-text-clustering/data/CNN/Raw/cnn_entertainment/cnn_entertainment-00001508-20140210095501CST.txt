Los Angeles (CNN) -- Comedic actor Chris Kattan was charged with driving under the influence after his car slammed into a highway construction truck on a Los Angeles freeway early Monday, a California Highway Patrol spokesman said.
Kattan, 43, suffered a bloody nose in the crash, but no workers were in the truck, Officer Leland Tang said.
"It could have been a lot worse," Tang said.
The former "Saturday Night Live" cast member failed field sobriety tests and was taken to the Los Angeles Police Department's Van Nuys precinct to be booked on the DUI charge, he said.
It is suspected that he was under the influence of an unknown drug, Tang said. A chemical test conducted by police will help identify the drug, he said.
Kattan was driving a black 2011 Mercedes on the Ventura Freeway where a California Department of Transportation crew was working just before 2 a.m. when the accident happened, Tang said.
Kattan posted a message to fans on his Twitter account Monday afternoon:
"Those concerned or just adding gossip: I'm fine, passed all tests, released without bail, have drivers license, cop offered to drive me home"
