(EW.com) -- The Sharknado sequel may just have a soundtrack by Sugar Ray.
SyFy announced Thursday that Mark McGrath, Kelly Osbourne, Judd Hirsch, Andy Dick, Judah Friedlander, and Vivica A. Fox will all appear in "Sharknado 2: The Second One." Osbourne will portray a flight attendant; Dick will play a New York City police officer. Friedlander will play the character of Brian, while Hirsch will be a cab driver (duh) named Ben. McGrath will play Ben's brother-in-law and Fox will portray Skye, an old high school friend of Fin (the returning Ian Ziering). Don't worry: Tara Reid will be returning as well.
EW: Best of 2013 (Behind the Scenes) - How a 'Sharknado' happens
In a press release announcing the casting news, this is the plot description given: "A freak weather system turns its deadly fury on New York City, unleashing a Sharknado on the population and its most cherished, iconic sites."
One can only hope that, once again, someone chainsaws their way out of a shark — maybe this time while standing on top of the Empire State Building?
