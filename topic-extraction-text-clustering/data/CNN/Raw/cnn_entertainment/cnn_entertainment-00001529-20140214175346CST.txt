(CNN) -- If you're trying to keep up with Kim Kardashian's little sister Kendall, you'll need to look on the runway.
Not that the 18-year-old reality star and model is hard to find.
As the second youngest member of the family featured on E!'s "Keeping Up with The Kardashians," Jenner is also carving out a career in high fashion. And on Thursday, she showed just how serious she is about her career.
At the Marc Jacobs show, held during New York Fashion Week, a nearly unrecognizable Jenner stalked the catwalk in a bobbed wig, pale eyebrows, and a sheer shirt with no bra. While fans of the reality series have watched the striking brunette grow up on TV they probably haven't ever seen her like this, and her haute look threw several for a loop.
Jenner hasn't responded personally to the attacks on social media, but she hasn't had to. Her older sister, Khloe Kardashian, has hit back at her sister's critics.
"She's too dope for you 2 understand! Yall would trade places with her in a second!" Kardashian tweeted. "The hate is real! Lol bye haters! #ModelLife #Simple"
And then, just to put a period on her point, the 29-year-old added: "Basic b*****s NOT wanted."
So what does Jenner's mom, Kris, think? She couldn't be happier. "I am so so proud of you @kendalljenner," Kris posted on Instagram.
And the beaming mom has plenty to applaud: Not only has her teen daughter taken New York Fashion Week by storm, but she's also made it into the hallowed fashion pages of Vogue magazine.
