(CNN) -- Simon Cowell got an extra sweet Valentine this year: a baby boy.
"The X Factor" creator and his girlfriend, Lauren Silverman, welcomed their first son together Friday, Cowell's reps told CNN. He came in at 5:45 p.m. in New York at 6 pounds and 7 ounces. The baby is named Eric Cowell.
Cowell shared the news with this tweet: "Very happy to say Eric was born at 17.45pm. Healthy and handsome. Lauren in great shape. Thanks for all of your kind messages. Named after my dad"
The reality TV executive and the 36-year-old New York socialite are spending their first Valentine's Day together along with their new son. They began their public relationship last summer, shortly after Silverman's ex-husband and Cowell's close friend, Andrew Silverman, filed for divorce in July, claiming the pair were involved in an extramarital affair.
In August, Cowell confirmed the media buzz that he and Silverman were expecting a child together. When asked on fellow "American Idol" alum Ryan Seacrest's radio show if he planned to marry Silverman, Cowell said, "Let's put it this way, I wouldn't expect her to be a single mother."
The baby is Cowell's first, and the second for Silverman, who has a son from her marriage.
