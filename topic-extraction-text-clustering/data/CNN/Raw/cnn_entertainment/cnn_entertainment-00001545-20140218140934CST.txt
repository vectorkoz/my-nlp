(CNN) -- Jimmy Fallon left us with great memories after five years on "Late Night," but the pressure was on for his first time hosting "The Tonight Show" on Monday.
Yet at the end of the hour, we were left with a "Tonight Show" that offered both surprising moments and big laughs, although it might've included a lot more than we'll see on an average night, since it was Fallon's first show.
Will Smith was the night's guest, U2 provided some music, and house band the Roots was as sharp as ever. (As Fallon said during his opening monologue, they're "the most talented band in all the land," and he "couldn't do the show" without them.)
That alone was a set-up for a great show, but Fallon also called on celebrity friends like Tina Fey and Stephen Colbert to help him get his version of "Tonight" off to a good start.
