(CNN) -- There is good news and bad news for CeeLo Green fans.
The "Crazy" singer says he will not be returning to NBC's competition show "The Voice," but fans may still be able to catch him in other projects. Green told Ellen DeGeneres on her talk show Wednesday that he will miss being on the singing series.
"I'm going to continue my relationship with NBC," he said. "I have a television show development deal with them as well and hopefully some other talk show opportunities for later in the year. But yeah, I'm going to miss 'The Voice' too."
