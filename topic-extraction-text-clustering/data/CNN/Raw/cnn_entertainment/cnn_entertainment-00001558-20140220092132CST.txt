(CNN) -- Unspecified "health reasons" forced Justin Timberlake to postpone Wednesday night's concert at New York's Madison Square Garden.
The singer tweeted the news Wednesday afternoon: "Hey NY. There is never an easy way to do this... Unfortunately, I have to postpone tonight's show to Friday due to health reasons."
The health concern must be a temporary one since his Thursday night performance of "The 20/20 Experience World Tour" is still scheduled, according to the Madison Square Garden website.
Tickets for Wednesday's show will be honored Friday night, the Garden said.
He's also scheduled to perform on "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon" Friday night.
Timberlake is in the middle of a world tour that will take him to Europe, the Middle East, Asia and through North America over the next six months.
