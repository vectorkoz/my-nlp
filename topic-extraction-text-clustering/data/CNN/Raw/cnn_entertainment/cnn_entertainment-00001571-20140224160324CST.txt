Los Angeles (CNN) -- R&B singer Robin Thicke and actress Paula Patton have separated, representatives for the couple told CNN.
Thicke and Patton, whose son Julian Fuego turns 4 in April, married in 2005. The couple met and began dating as teenagers.
"We will always love each other and be best friends, however, we have mutually decided to separate at this time," the couple said in a joint statement released to the media.
They dismissed rumors swirling last year that their marriage was on the rocks. "I don't know if I would still be alive in some ways if it wasn't for Paula," Thicke told Prestige Hong Kong magazine in September. "She's been my rock, my muse, my inspiration and I love her. The whole way."
They appeared together on the Grammys red carpet last month. He is currently on a national concert tour, while she was most recently seen in the film "About Last Night."
Their reps gave no additional details, such as if a divorce filing is in the works.
CNN's Topher Gauk-Roger contributed to this report.
