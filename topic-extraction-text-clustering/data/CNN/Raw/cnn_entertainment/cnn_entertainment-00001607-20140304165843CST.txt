(CNN) -- A Florida court technician has the job of blurring Justin Bieber's private parts on jail video before you can see it.
The video will then be handed over to CNN and other news agencies this week under Florida's open records law, a Miami judge ordered Tuesday.
It's part of several hours of video captured by surveillance cameras inside the Miami Beach Police Department's jail, where Bieber was held after his arrest on DUI charges on January 23.
Miami-Dade County Judge William Altfield rejected arguments from Bieber's lawyer that the video should be kept private.
"The court finds that images of the defendant while in custody at the Miami Beach Police Department are relevant to the public's right to know," Altfield ruled Tuesday.
The segments to be released include a sequence in which Bieber "appears to be urinating" in a cell, "revealing an image of the defendant's genitalia," the judge wrote.
The order, however, instructs the court's video technician to blur "the image wherein genitalia is observed."
"While the defendant may not enjoy all of the expectations of privacy that he enjoys outside of a jail setting, he still retains his expectation of dignity," the judge said.
Several photographs taken by police of Bieber showing his tattoos were given to the media Tuesday.
Video showing Bieber doing push-ups in a jail cell and attempting a sobriety test in a hallway were released last month.
Florida's open records law gives the news media full access to documents, photographs and video collected by police unless there is a compelling reason to keep them private.
A status hearing is set for March 11 in Bieber's DUI case, which also includes a charge of resisting arrest without violence and driving with an expired license.
