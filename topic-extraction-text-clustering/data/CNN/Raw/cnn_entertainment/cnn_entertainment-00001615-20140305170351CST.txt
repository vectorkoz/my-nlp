(EW.com) -- Patricia Arquette is the newest CSI franchise star. The Emmy-winning Medium actress has been cast in the lead role in CBS' upcoming "CSI" spinoff.
The project is set in the FBI's Cyber Crime Division in Quantico, VA and follows a team "tasked to solve high octane crimes that start in the mind, live online, and play out into the real world." Arquette will play Avery Ryan, the special agent in charge of the unit.
The role marks Arquette's return to broadcast TV since she starred in "Medium," which ran for six years and racked up 130 episodes across two networks (NBC and CBS). She also had an arc on HBO's "Boardwalk Empire" last year, in addition to appearing in films like "True Romance" and "Ed Wood."
The fourth incarnation of the CSI brand will air as an implanted episode later this season (fellow CBS crime-show acronym "NCIS" also has a spinoff this season — "NCIS: New Orleans," starring Scott Bakula). The new spin-off is written and produced by franchise veterans Carol Mendelsohn, Anthony E. Zuiker, Ann Donahue; exec produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and Jonathan Littman, plus adds producer Mary Aiken, who inspired the concept via her work as a "cyber psychologist."
