(EW.com) -- Lindsay Lohan is about to make life a little harder for Max and Caroline on "2 Broke Girls."
CBS announced Wednesday that the actress is set to appear in an episode of its female-led comedy, playing a character named Claire Guinness, a bride-to-be who enlists Max (Kat Dennings) and Caroline (Beth Behrs) to make her wedding cake.

But soon after taking the gig, it becomes clear to the cake-making duo that Claire has trouble making decisions. The episode is scheduled to air April 14.
This is far from the first time Lohan has appeared on the small screen. She has done guest spots on "Glee," "Anger Management" and "Ugly Betty," and will soon be the subject of a documentary series on the OWN network.
