Los Angeles (CNN) -- Singer Chris Brown has been taken into custody by Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies after being made to leave court-ordered drug rehab, a sheriff's spokesman said Friday.
In late February, a Los Angeles judge ordered Brown to stay another two months in the anger management and drug rehab program in Malibu, California, that he'd entered three months earlier.
Brown ordered to stay in rehab
His legal troubles began five years ago when he beat then-girlfriend Rihanna in a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood street. He pleaded guilty to felony assault in June 2009, which resulted in a sentence of five years of probation and 1,400 hours of community labor.
The judge revoked Brown's probation twice in the last year, most recently because of his arrest on a sidewalk near the White House after allegedly punching a man.
