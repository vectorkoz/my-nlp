<TIME>Mon, 17 Mar 2014 17:11:09 EDT</TIME>
<ABSTRACT>
Sony's aggressive expansion of its rebooted "Amazing Spider-Man" franchise began last summer with the announcement of release dates for "Amazing 3" and "4" in 2016 and 2018, respectively — meaning that the 2010s will be the first decade in human history with one "Spider-Man" movie every two years, so take that, 2000s!

(EW.com) -- Sony's aggressive expansion of its rebooted "Amazing Spider-Man" franchise began last summer with the announcement of release dates for "Amazing 3" and "4" in 2016 and 2018, respectively — meaning that the 2010s will be the first decade in human history with one "Spider-Man" movie every two years, so take that, 2000s!
However, not everyone will stick around for the full quadrilogy: Director Marc Webb will take himself and his contextually perfect surname away from the director's chair after "Amazing 3."

"I want to help and contribute, but I think three movies...honestly, that's it for me," Webb tells EW. "I want to try other things."
Webb did allow for the possibility that he could stick around as a consultant on Sony's whole Spidey franchise — an idea he also floated with The Daily Beast.

There is some precedent for the consulting role: "Avengers" director Joss Whedon has worked on other Marvel Studios films, while original "X-Men" director Bryan Singer produced "First Class" before making a return trip to the director's chair on this summer's "Days of Future Past."
