(CNN) -- Despite what you may read on your Twitter timeline, the Kurt Cobain death probe has not been reopened, a Seattle Police spokeswoman told CNN Thursday.
"Mr. Cobain is still deceased and the case is still a suicide," Det. Renee Witt said. "We did not reopen the case."
The department's cold-case detective Mike Ciesenski recently pulled the case file to refresh himself because of the media interest connected to the 20th anniversary of the death on April 4, Witt said.
Det. Ciesenski found four rolls of undeveloped film in the file, which he then had printed. The crime scene images he found were "benign, nothing that was new or anything that would change the outcome of the investigation," she said. "It still remains a suicide."
The 1994 investigation concluded that Cobain, 27, committed suicide by shooting himself with a shotgun while high on heroin and pills. An electrician found his body in a Lake Washington home.
Social networks erupted Thursday with posts suggesting there was something new in Cobain's death probe after Seattle TV station KIRO published a story on its website titled "Seattle police re-examine Kurt Cobain death." The station promised it would show viewers one of the previously unseen crime scene photos.
CNN's Cheri Mossburg contributed to this report.
