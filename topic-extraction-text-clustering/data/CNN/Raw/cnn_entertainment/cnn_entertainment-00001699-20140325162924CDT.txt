(RS.com) -- The saga continues.
Sean Combs -- who has put out records under the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy and who has appeared in movies using his own name and a few Diddy-like variations thereof -- has decided to come full circle and resume using the Puff Daddy name.
The moniker change-up will accompany a new album, reportedly named "MMM," according to Radio.com. It will be the rapper's first album since 2010's "Last Train to Paris," but does not currently have a release date.
Watch Sean Combs' spoof 'Downton Diddy'
Combs included the new old name in a one-minute trailer (incidentally, posted to Vimeo by the "Diddy" account) for his latest single, "Big Homie," which features guest appearances by Rick Ross and French Montana.
The clip shows the rappers in various states of suspension until a gunshot triggers close-ups of stacks of cash and jewelry and wide shots of the group hanging out at a car wash. The video will come out on Monday, March 31.
Diddy leads top hip-hop earners list
Combs began his music career in the early '90s alternating between the name Puffy and his own name for remixes on releases by Father M.C., Jodeci and Mary J. Blige.
He executive-produced the Notorious B.I.G.'s debut "Ready to Die" as Sean "Puffy" Combs and, in 1997, put out his first full-length, "No Way Out," under the Puff Daddy name, which graced two albums total.
His 2001 album "The Saga Continues..." was his first as P. Diddy and his 2006 LP "Press Play" was his first as Diddy.
