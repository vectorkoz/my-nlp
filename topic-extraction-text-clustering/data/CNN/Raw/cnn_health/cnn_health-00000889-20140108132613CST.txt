(CNN) -- Though Jahi McMath is no longer in an Oakland, California, hospital, her family is tight-lipped about where the brain-dead teen is and just what they plan to do with her.
The eighth-grader's family needs to "heal up from this whole experience" and have "some quiet time" away from media questions, their attorney Chris Dolan said Wednesday.
He declined to say if the girl has been transferred to another facility and, if so, to describe that facility.
Children's Hospital & Research Center Oakland released Jahi on Sunday to the Alameda County coroner, who then released her to her mother's custody, said Dr. David Durand, the hospital's chief of pediatrics. The hospital had previously said it needed the coroner's consent for the transfer because the girl was legally dead.
That brought to a close a weeks-long battle between the hospital, which wanted to remove the teen from a ventilator, and her family, who believed she was showing signs of life.
A judge concluded that the teen was brain-dead after a December 9 operation to remove her tonsils, adenoids and extra sinus tissue.

Doctors had recommended the surgery to treat pediatric obstructive sleep apnea, a condition that made her stop breathing in her sleep and caused other medical problems.
Jahi, 13, was alert and talking to doctors after the procedure, even asking for a Popsicle because her throat hurt. That was a relief in some ways because she had expressed to her family that she was very concerned about the surgery. She had said she felt she would never wake up from it, her uncle has said.
But in the intensive care unit, the girl started to bleed, her family has said, and she went into cardiac arrest. Days later, she was declared brain-dead.
Privacy laws have prohibited hospital officials from talking in detail about her case.
After releasing the teen, the hospital said: "Our hearts go out to the family as they grieve for this sad situation and we wish them closure and peace."
McMath's experience made national headlines and fueled a debate about what legally and ethically constitutes death.
Medical ethicists have said that the case has fed into a misperception that "brain death" is not death; that somehow, the body can live on, and that is life.
It's also sparked fierce emotion, and that is another reason the family is keeping quiet about where the girl will be taken. "We've had people make threats from around the country," Dolan, the family attorney, has told CNN. "It's sad that people act that way."
