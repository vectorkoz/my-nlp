(CNN) -- The doctor's words -- "You won't be able to run again" -- ran through my mind, again and again.
It was 2003, and I had just been told I needed a hip replacement. Bad hips are common in my family, and years of sports and working as a Baltimore city police officer had taken their toll sooner than I expected.
"You won't be able to run again." I knew that one statement could very well cost me my livelihood; as a police officer, you have to be able to run.
I was 34 years young. I had a 2-year-old child.
Sitting in the doctor's office, I cried. I was too young not to run. I had no idea what I was going to do, or if I was even going to get this operation.
My doctor told me that if I didn't have surgery I would be bound to a wheelchair within a couple of months.
So on September 23, 2003, I got my hip replaced.
Cancer robbed me of my health; now I'm taking it back
Once I recovered from surgery I made up in my mind that this was not going to defeat me. My favorite Bible verse came to mind, Philippians 4:13: "I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me."
So I got up and started walking. If running was out of the question, I was going to do everything in my power to stay active.
Eight years later, in 2011, the same hip started to give me problems once again, and the doctor told me I needed another surgery.
That dying patient could have been me
After my second hip replacement, I knew had to get myself together and beat this demon. I have been competitive all my life. More determined than ever to prove my doctor wrong, I got a trainer and enlisted help from my co-worker.
My trainer started me off with cardio, weight training and a healthier diet. My co-worker and I began to walk outside, then very slowly began to run. Just baby steps. I had a little pain in my hip at times, but nothing stopped me from doing the workouts.
Over time, those baby steps became big girl steps.
Never did I think I would love running as much as I do. In 2013, I ran my very first race: a 10K, which is 6.1 miles. The feeling I had when I crossed that finish line was unbelievable. The joy I felt I can't explain.
I pushed through two hip replacements to run five 5K races and a half marathon. Now I'm training for a triathlon. What's your excuse?
You see, you can do anything if you put your mind to it. Do you have something that someone told you you couldn't do? Don't believe them. If I can do it, you can too.
