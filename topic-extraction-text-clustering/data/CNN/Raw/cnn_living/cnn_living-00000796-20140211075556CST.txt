Tune in to AC360Â° Wednesday, Thursday and Friday night at 8 p.m. for a three-part series, "Baby Brains: What Are They Really Thinking?"
(CNN) -- Dawn Soto often looks at her toddler's expressive face and tries to decipher his inner monologue. She wonders, "What goes through their little minds with all these new experiences?"
Any parent of a young child imagines what their baby is thinking about. Recently, Anderson Cooper traveled to the Infant Cognition Center at Yale University where he watched babies take part in a series of tests aimed at answering the question: "Are we born knowing right from wrong?" He explores that question and other aspects of babies' inner thoughts in a three-part special this week on baby brains.
In that spirit, iReport invited parents to share photos of their babies and guess what they were thinking at that moment.
