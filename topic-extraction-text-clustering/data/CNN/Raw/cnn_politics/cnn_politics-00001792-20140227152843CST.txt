(CNN) -- Attorney General Eric Holder was hospitalized briefly on Thursday after becoming lightheaded and experiencing shortness of breath, the Justice Department said.
Holder, 63, experienced symptoms during a regular senior-staff meeting in the morning and his FBI security detail called an ambulance.
He was treated and evaluated at MedStar Washington Hospital Center and later released, according to a law enforcement source.
While at the hospital, Holder was alert and talking with doctors.
He received medication that "quickly restored his heart rate to a normal level" and successfully completed a full range of tests, Justice Department spokesman Brian Fallon said.
Holder was at home and resting by mid-afternoon.
Fallon said Holder experienced similar, but milder symptoms several years ago that did not "require serious medical attention."
"Throughout today, the attorney general has remained alert and in good spirits," Fallon said.
No further details were released.
President Barack Obama was notified of the development and wished him "a speedy recovery," White House spokesman Jay Carney said.
Holder has been attorney general throughout Obama's presidency and is the first African American to hold the post.
He is married to a doctor and has three children.
