Our panel of pros tells you where to ski. Or at least where they do.
</ABSTRACT>
<TEXT>
(CNN) -- What great beaches are to summer, ski runs are to winter.
To make sure the snow hounds among us get equal treatment to the beach bums, we asked some of the world's top skiers, snowboarders and winter sports journalists to name their favorite ski run.
Our panel included Andrew Weibrecht, Olympic medalist and U.S. ski team member; John Stifter, editor at U.S. ski bible Powder magazine; Mike Douglas, the godfather of free-skiing and creator of the world's first twin-tip ski; and Nicola Iseard, editor of the UK's top ski magazine, Fall Line.
They helped us come up with this list of some of the world's most exhilarating ski runs.
Difficulty evaluations for each run were provided by the respective resorts and reflect a mix of rating systems.
While the resorts of Europe and North America understandably dominated the list, the novelty factor of skiing in some of the world's lesser known ski destinations resulted in a few less predictable recommendations.

100. Saulire, Three Valleys, France
"One of my favorite runs is the Saulire," says Emily Sarsfield, Great Britain's current number one ski-X athlete.
"It stretches all the way from the Meribel/Courchevel connection at 2,700 meters to Meribel Village at 1,400 meters. It's a great long run with really wide pistes and great views down the valley."
Watch out for: Rapid descent.

99. Valluga, St. Anton, Austria
St. Anton's huge, powder-filled bowls attract skiers and snowboarders, but for many, the highlight is the 3,000-meter Valluga run.
You're not allowed to board the lift to the top without a guide, and the first section is challenging.
After that you encounter a series of powder fields before reachig Z체rs -- famous for its mountaintop restaurants.
Watch out for: Powder-filled bowls.

98. The Cliff, Big White, British Columbia
According to Team GB snowboarder Becky Menday, you can't do much better than The Cliff for adrenaline.

Watch out for: Snowboarders crushing it at warp speed.

97. McConkey's, Squaw Valley, California
Once known as Eagle's Nest, this run was renamed after the tragic death of Squaw Valley local Shane McConkey.

Watch out for: Other people.

92. No. 3, Mount Hermon Ski Resort, Israel
Mount Herman is known as the Eyes of the Nation because of the views into Syria from the summit.

86. Grande Combe, Jebel Attar, Oukaimeden, Morocco
Africa's highest ski resort is located 10,000 feet above sea level, 80 kilometers from Marrakech.
The resort is one of the world's most bizarre places to ski or snowboard -- there's just one chairlift but locals often opt for a donkey ride to the top of the ungraded runs, the majority of which start from the peak of Jebel Attar.
A steep mogul field, Grande Combe offers the best terrain at the resort.
Watch out for: The donkey ski lift.
Rating: Ungraded

This run was used for the downhill event at the 1994 Winter Olympics.
Although it's rated black, on powder days it's suitable for intermediate skiers.

Watch out for: Jumps -- they demand a lot if you hit them.

82. Br채ma schwer, Jakobshorn-Teufi, Davos, Switzerland
Few runs in the Jakobshorn ski area are groomed, which makes the whole place a favorite with advanced skiers.

81. Kill the Banker, Revelstoke, British Columbia
"Kill the Banker at Revelstoke Mountain Resort has to be one of the most fun runs in the world," says pro skier and Dynastar athlete Sean Cochrane.

South America's largest ski resort has one of its craziest (and funnest) runs.

23. Sparks Lane, Mount Bachelor, Oregon
Laurenne Ross, an Audi FIS Alpine World Cup Downhill podium finisher, says Mount Bachelor is one for speedsters.
"Sparks Lake is my all-time favorite run," says Ross. "It's reminiscent of a downhill course: twists and turns, steeps and flats, jumps and banked turns, I still love flying down that run at full-speed -- there's no better feeling in the world."
Watch out for: Banked turns.

Best payoff for Alta's High Boy run?
The bar at the end.
"At the top you get an insane view down the canyon all the way down to valley floor," says pro skier Julian Carr, world record holder for the highest invert ever performed (translation: a very big jump).
"Once you drop in, it's steep and sustained good times all the way to the bottom, legs-a-burning, straight to the Sitzmark bar for a tasty beverage."
Watch out for: Too many celebratory beers.

Dynastar World Cup Ski Racer Dominique Gisin loves the first run he ever skied.
"My favorite slope in the world is called Rotegg and it's part of my home ski area, Titlis in Engelberg," says Gisin. "It's the first black slope I skied as a kid. It's a steep and impressive couloir that connects the glacier to the rest of the ski area.
"There are big bumps all over the place. I think that's why I was never that impressed with all the tough courses in World Cup."
Watch out for: Local speed demons.

14. Corbet's Couloir, Jackson Hole, Wyoming
This double black run is short (just 150 meters) and scary. It's been called the world's scariest slope by several publications, including USA Today.
"Corbet's Couloir is one of the best measuring sticks for expert skiers in the world," says pro skier Griffin Post. "A 15-foot drop gives way to a several-hundred-foot, 40-degree powder run. Although it's a breathtaking drop, the reward (survival) is well worth it."
Watch out for: Courage. You'll need it.

9. The Palisades, Squaw Valley, California
The Palisades earns its place because watching the local experts on this slope is almost as exciting as tackling it yourself.
It's the first run that Powder Magazine editor John Stifter heads to when the snow falls.
"The Palisades run beneath the KT-22 lift allows for massive airs and huge lines off all the cliffs and down the steeps," says Stifter.
"The varied location and terrain are why people refer to the area as Squallywood. The best of the best show up here to make their mark in hopes of becoming the next Scot Schmidt or Shane McConkey."
Watch out for: The fearless snowboarders Squaw Valley is famous for.

5. Grand Solliet, Sainte Foy, France
"This French ski run is deceptive," says Fall Line magazine editor Nicola Iseard.
"On paper it doesn't look that exciting -- a long blue piste that starts at the top of the Marquise chairlift.
"But, when it comes to letting your skis run fast on a sunny, often empty slope -- crowds in Sainte Foy are rare -- it seems to go on forever. It gives access to some awesome off-piste sections through the trees, too."
Watch out for: The time -- it's best to hit this run late in the day.
