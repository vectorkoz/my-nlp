</ABSTRACT>
<TEXT>
(CNN) -- The Philippines has launched a global campaign to thank the world for its outpouring of help following last year's devastating typhoon that killed more than 8,000 people.
As part of the initiative, a series of electronic billboards were lit up with "Thank you" signs in some of the world's most famous locations, including New York's Times Square, Tokyo's Shibuya Crossing, London's Piccadilly Circus and Galeries Lafayette in Paris.
Filipinos are also sending out messages of thanks on Twitter with the hashtag #PHthankyou.
The campaign, kicked off by the Philippines Department of Tourism, launched on February 8 -- exactly three months after Super Typhoon Haiyan hit.
Given how gracious the nation is being, it's a fine time to revisit one of the Philippines best assets -- its 7,000 islands, edged by white sand buffering turquoise waters filled with some of the world's most diverse marine life.
And most of them are relatively unexplored.
Of course, not everyone will agree on which one is best but this is a good starting point.
Disagree with our picks? Share your favorite Filipino island or beach in the comments box below.
1. El Nido, Palawan
If Palawan is indeed "the last frontier" of the Philippines, as it's been dubbed, the coastal town of El Nido is the gateway to wild adventure.
Sure, it's got powder-fine beaches and gin-clear waters. But the views are what really sell the place.
Off the coast of El Nido are majestic karst limestone formations, empty lagoons, marble cliffs, prehistoric caves and waterfalls. All are easily explored.
What to do: El Nido is a popular base for divers. Surrounding waters contain more than 50 species of coral, and attract whales, whale sharks, sea cows, manta rays, dolphins and endangered turtles.
2. Boracay, Aklan
White Beach is the place most frequently associated with Boracay, the most popular holiday destination in the Philippines.
Its four-kilometer stretch welcomes everyone from beach bums to adventurers. At night, the beach comes alive with candle-lit sand castles, cozy restaurants and bars that stay open til dawn.
Away from White Beach are calmer resorts. There is a less boisterous side of Boracay and it still offers secluded strips of sand, coves, caves and cliffs.
What to do: During the early months of the year, Boracay attracts hundreds of kite-boarders and windsurfers who compete in the International Funboard Cup. The rough waves and strong winds make Boracay an ideal destination for water sports fanatics.
3. Palaui Island, Cagayan Valley
This isolated island is a natural secret -- only the brave and persevering bother to visit.
Glorious white sands surrounded by volcanic rocks on one side kiss blue-green waters on the other. Snorkeling and diving brings you face to face with coral gardens and a rich marine reserve.
Palaui is all about raw beauty. But it takes some work to get there.

Treks should be blessed with clear blue skies, patient companions and trusted local guides.
Getting to the island's most prized stretch of beach requires battling thorny grass, muddy ground and a mangrove forest.
Uncharted Philippines offers a three-day Palaui Island Photography Tour for $240 that includes transportation, accomodation, food and guides.
What to do: With no resorts or hotels, Palaui has only one real option -- camping under the stars. Otherwise, visitors are left to explore homestay options.
4. Panglao, Bohol
Once a sleepy island, Panglao is being roused by travelers in search of gorgeous beaches.
It's a refuge for those who appreciate a diverse menu of aquatic attractions.
Options include dolphin watching, whale spotting, diving with barracudas, jackfish, sea snakes and brilliant coral formations.
Natural charms: In addition to its beaches, the island of Bohol is famous for its Chocolate Hills, an unusual rolling terrain of more than 1,000 dome-shaped hills. The hills are named for their brown color during dry season, when grass dries up.
The "world's smallest primate" -- the endangered Philippine tarsier -- also inhabits the island.
Random fact: Years ago, a number of foreigners came to Panglao on holiday and never bothered to leave. Locals picked up their languages to better converse with the tourists. In addition to English, in Panglao you have a good chance of meeting a local with a handy grasp of German, Swiss or Japanese.
5. Bantayan Island, Cebu
Bantayan has remained relatively untouched by modern life, save for a smattering of foreigners who have taken up residence, sucked in by the island's white sands, aqua-colored waters and red-gold sunsets.
Beers are cold and cheap, townsfolk are hospitable and the dreary troubles of the outside world are easily forgotten.
Holy crowds: If you're after peace and quiet, don't plan a stay during the Holy Week before Easter. The island is crowded with Filipino travelers during this period, with rooms and services booked months in advance.
What to do: Relax. Action-packed it ain't. There are no five-star hotels, no malls, no fashion-forward shopping centers.

6. Caramoan, Camarines Sur
Named after the local sea turtle, Caramoan is as scenic as it is secluded.
Stretches of white sand run between huge boulders and rock formations. Scuba divers, island hoppers and beach bums all converge here.
Complementing the beaches are caves, waterfalls, freshwater pools, underground streams and lagoons.
Adventure site: The "Survivor" reality show series and similar international programs have used Caramoan as a shooting location.
Despite the locale's popularity with TV production companies, there are enough beaches to go around for everyone.
What to do in the Philippines: Mountain climbers can trek to Mount Caglago's summit and take in a terrific view of the Caramoan islands and islets. The mountain is a pilgrimage site for some, thanks to its gigantic statue of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary.
7. Samal, Davao
A burgeoning tourist destination, Samal is on a mission to get the word out on its 118-kilometer coastline of white sandy beaches.
You know the highlights: pristine waters, lush greens, rock formations, mangrove and coconut palms. Numerous resorts provide a range of choices for visitors, from luxurious resorts to backpacker options.
The vanishing island: This curious moniker is the nickname of Shanipaan Shoal, a tiny island that literally disappears from sight during high tide. The only thing visible at high water is a single, elevated cottage poking out of the sea.
What to do in the Philippines: The vast Coral Garden Marine Park, a fish sanctuary filled with diverse marine life, makes Sambal a favorite among divers and snorkelers.
8. Siargao Islands, Surigao del Norte
Known as the top surfing island in the Philippines, Siargao is often overlooked as a beachcomber's paradise.
There are breaks for beginner surfers, moderate ones and even pros looking for three-meter-high waves. For those with zero surf skills -- and no desire to acquire any -- there are also pristine beaches with milder waves, perfect for sunning and swimming.
MORE: 36 hours on a Philippine bus
What to do in the Philippines: Ideal days for surfing are between mid-August and mid-December, when the swell is most consistent. Beginners should visit when waves are smaller, around April or May.
9. Great Santa Cruz Island, Zamboanga
On Great Santa Cruz Island, pulverized red coral washed up from the sea floor mixes with white sand to produce a pink-hued beach.
It's a different version of perfection: the powdery beach competes with the blue and green shades of the sea. Some parts of the beach are lovely in their undeveloped state. There are signs of civilization -- souvenirs, nipa huts and restrooms.
Beach visits are limited to day trips, so you have to squeeze everything into a few hours: swim, sunbathe, snorkel, dive, even fish for your lunch. Just don't mistake serenity for safety -- there's a deep drop in the sea just meters from shore.
What to do in the Philippines: The island is just a boat ride away from the city proper, but getting there requires extra precautions, due to local threats.
Only those with a tourist permit from the Department of Tourism in Zamboanga City can visit. The permit fee includes armed security escorts.
Why the need for security? According to the Department of Tourism's regional office, it's a preventative measure: "On the security situation in Zamboanga City, there are no militant or terroristic activities recently. Although there were reported shooting incidents, these were intended to specific victims due to personal grudges. The city is very vibrant and relatively peaceful."
As a precaution, check with your embassy for security threats before traveling.
10. Pagudpud/Bangui, Ilocos Norte
Along the northern tip of the island of Luzon sits the coastal town of Pagudpud. It's a quiet, sleepy and rural community, with little overt commercialism.
Perhaps because it takes time and effort to reach Pagudpud, the wide and inviting beaches are usually empty, making them ideal for those who enjoy mixing solitude with sun, sand and surf.
A row of windmills down the coast from Pagudpud in the town of Bangui makes for a picturesque if not unusual backdrop for a Filipino beach. (See above photo.)

What to do in the Philippines: Parts of Pagudpud are exposed to winds that blow in from both the South China Sea and Pacific Ocean, making the waves ideal for surfers, especially from July to October. Windsurfers and kiteboarders are starting to take notice of this northern getaway.
