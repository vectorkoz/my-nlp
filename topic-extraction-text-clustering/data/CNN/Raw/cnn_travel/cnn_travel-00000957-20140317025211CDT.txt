(CNN) -- A Delta Air Lines plane lost a panel on one of its wings during a flight from Orlando to Atlanta on Sunday. It landed safely.
"Crew members aboard Flight 2412 reported an access panel had come off the plane's wing while in flight," said Delta spokesman Anthony Black.
Flight 2412, with 179 passengers and six crew members, landed without incident at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport.
Black called the incident "highly unusual" and said, "the problems with the wing did not affect the plane's ability to fly or operable change in flight."
Officials are inspecting the aircraft to determine a cause.
The plane was a Boeing 757, but Black did not know how old it was.
