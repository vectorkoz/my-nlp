Self-proclaimed professional Bigfoot hunter, Rick Dyer, has finally released the photos of the hairy monster he allegedly shot and killed last year.
"Bigfoot is 100 percent real – there's no question about that," Dyer told KSAT.com.
Dyer says he shot and killed the mythical monster in a wooded area of California near Loop 1604 and Highway 151 in September 2012.

Until Thursday, Dyer provided no evidence of his kill outside of a grainy video he shot of the creature. The video was included in a documentary called "Shooting Bigfoot" which failed to convince skeptics.
Following a dispute with his investors, Dyer told KSAT he was able to reclaim the body and released a photo of “Bigfoot” on his website.
"Every test that you can possibly imagine was performed on this body -- from DNA tests to 3D optical scans to body scans," Dyer told KSAT. "It is the real deal. It's Bigfoot and Bigfoot's here, and I shot it and now I'm proving it to the world."
Dyer invited more than 100 people to come and see the body up close for themselves.
"We wanted to get people's reactions, make them believers, and we did it to over a 130 people," Dyer said. "We definitely made them believers."
Dyer promised that this time he is not simply crying wolf.
"Bigfoot is not a tooth fairy -- Bigfoot is real," Dyer said. "The most important thing to me is being vindicated, letting people know that I am the best Bigfoot tracker in the world and it's not just me saying it."
Dyer will take the body on tour across North American where he will charge a fee to view the body.
