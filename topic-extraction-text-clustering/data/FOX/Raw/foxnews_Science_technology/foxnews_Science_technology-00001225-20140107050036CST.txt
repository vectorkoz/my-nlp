Single-digit temperatures may not be much fun, but they can make for some interesting experiments.
- Fill a mug with boiling water and watch what happens when you throw it in the air. The water steams as it creates a smoke cloud and the water freezes instantly on the ground.
- Grab a bottle of bubbles from the summer beach bag and take them outside. Watch as they freeze in their shape and break into pieces when touched.
- Stick a banana outside for about an hour or two and itâ€™ll get as hard as a hammer.
- If you want to see how fast water freezes, take a wet t-shirt and hold it outside. In about one minute, it should be rock solid.
Go ahead, and try these experiments at home. Just make sure you dress for the occasion.
