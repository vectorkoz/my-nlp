Dueling scientific studies are investigating man's earliest common male ancestor -- and the latest claims he walked the earth 209,000 years ago, thousands of years earlier than scientists originally believed.
The new study from the University of Sheffield and the University of Houston also claims to debunk the earlier, peer-reviewed research from the University of Arizona, which said the discovery of the Y chromosome predates humanity.
"We can say with some certainty that modern humans emerged in Africa a little over 200,000 years ago," Eran Elhaik from the University of Sheffield said in a press release.
Elhaik and Dan Graur of the University of Houston used conventional biological models to date "Adam" -- man's common male ancestor, borrowing the name from the Bible -- to his rightful place in evolutionary history. A whopping 9,000 years earlier, to be exact.
"It is obvious that modern humans did not interbreed with hominins living over 500,000 years ago," Elhaik said. "It is also clear that there was no single 'Adam' and 'Eve' but rather groups of 'Adams and Eves' living side by side and wandering together in our world."
Elhaik and Graur's research finds that the first male and female ancestors of mankind originated at the same time. This directly contradicts a recent study from Arizona Research Labs at the University of Arizona, which Â found that the human Y chromosome originated through interbreeding among a different species and dates 'Adam' to be twice as old.
"We have shown that the University of Arizona study lacks any scientific merit," Elhaik claimed. "In fact, their hypothesis creates a sort of 'space-time paradox' whereby the most ancient individual belonging to Homo sapiens species has not yet been born."
Think of the Michael J. Fox film, "Back the the Future." Marty was worried that his parents would not meet and so he would not be born in the future. "It's the same idea," Elhaik said.
"The question to what extent did our human forbears interbreed with their closest relatives is one of the hottest questions in anthropology that remains open."
Arizona researchers did not immediately respond to FoxNews.com requests for comment.
