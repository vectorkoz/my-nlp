BORYSEW, Poland –  A private zoo owner in central Poland feels three times lucky with the birth of white lion triplets who are getting loving care from their mother.
Andrzej Pabich, head of the zoo in Borysew, said white lions often have defects that prevent giving birth, or mothers may reject the cubs. Triplets are rare.
Pabich told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the 2 ½ -year old white lioness Azira has been patiently feeding and caring for the cubs that were born Jan. 28. Their father, 3 ½-year old Sahim, who is also white, is kept in a neighboring cage.
The cubs will be allowed into an outdoor run in April.
Opened in 2008, the zoo has animals of 80 species including white tigers and white camels.
