On Feb. 9, 1964, The Beatles took the state at the Ed Sullivan Theater for their first U.S. show. 
The TV broadcast, carried by very high frequence waves, traveled at the speed of light to 73 million viewers, then out into space. Those waves are now nearly 300 trillion miles away -- and still traveling.
They reached Alpha Centauri, 4.4 light years away, in 1968. They stretched out to Sirius, 8.6 light years away, 5 years later. By the time The Beatles were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, the signal from that broadcast had traveled 24.4 light years to 107 Piscium, an orange dwarf star in the Pisces constellation.
