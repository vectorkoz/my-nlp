An 8-foot-long octopus plunged at two divers off Bluefish Cove in Carmel, California and they have the pictures to prove it.
David Malvestuto and Warren Murray were enjoying a scuba diving excursion when they came across the resting sea creature.
They initially thought the animal was a large rock but were shocked when the octopus jumped into action and started arm wrestling with their camera.
"I was a little concerned ... but we both knew they are harmless," Murray told the NY Daily News.
One thing Murray and Malvestuto were concerned about was catching the close encounter on tape.
"We can say we did all of these things but we made sure we had the video and pictures to prove it," he said.
Watch their tussle with the octopus below.
