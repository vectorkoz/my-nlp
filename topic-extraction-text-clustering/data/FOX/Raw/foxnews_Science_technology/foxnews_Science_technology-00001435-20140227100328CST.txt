A mountain lion and her kittens having a late-night snack were recorded via a remote camera in a Southern California wilderness park. 
The Los Angeles Times reports more than 350 high-quality images were snapped as the three cats fed on a mule deer over two nights in Malibu Creek State Park last week.
Biologist Jeff Sikich with the National Park Service says the cameras were set up to check on the male and female kittens, P-30 and P-28, who biologists haven't seen since they were tagged when they were a few weeks old.
The kittens are now 10 months old and Sikich says they appear healthy.
The park service has captured and collared more than 30 cougars in the Santa Monica Mountains during a study started in 2002.
