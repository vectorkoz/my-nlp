ROME –  Top Italian culture officials are calling for swift action to save Pompeii, the ancient Roman city encased in volcanic ash, from further ruin after heavy rains reportedly caused part of a wall to collapse.
Giancarlo Galan, the head of a parliamentary culture commission, on Sunday lamented the latest collapse at the archaeological site near Naples.
Italian media reported that Saturday's rainstorm provoked the partial collapse of a wall around a necropolis and caused some stones to fall at The Temple of Venus.
Despite the damage, Pompeii remained open to tourists Sunday.  But its offices were closed and further details were not immediately available.
Last year, the Italian government appointed a special official to ensure that European Union and Italian funds were properly spent to repair and protect Pompeii.
