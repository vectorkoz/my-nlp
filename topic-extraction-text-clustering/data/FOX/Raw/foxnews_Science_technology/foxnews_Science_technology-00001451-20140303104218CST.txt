A zoo in North Korea has reportedly welcomed its newest animal attraction -- a pack of Yorkshire Terriers.
The miniature dogs have been introduced to Central Zoo in the capital Pyongyang, according to state media.
Korea Central News Agency (KCNA) said the dogs are now learning "several feats," although it did not elaborate on the type of tricks they might perform.
North Koreans not familiar with "Yorkies," which were bred in Yorkshire to catch rats and mice by scuttling around clothing mills, were given a helpful guide to the pint-sized pet.
"Each one has long hair -- tan on its head and legs and blue grey on its body," KCNA reported.
"It is 22-24cm tall and weighs 2.5-3.5kg. It lives about 14 years on an average."
A picture released by KCNA appeared to show three Yorkshire Terriers in seemingly good condition.
