Some jars of the popular Italian sauce Prego are being recalled because of their potential to spoil.
The Campbell Soup Company recently announced that it is recalling 300 cases of Prego Traditional Italian sauce in 24-ounce jars. The recalled sauce was shipped on Dec. 21 to retail distribution centers in seven states: Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico and Oklahoma, according to the Food and Drug Administration.
The company did not say why the products might spoil, but said the risk was discovered during routine testing. So far, no illnesses have been linked to the recall. The recalled products can be identified by the "Best By" date of June 16, 2015, and a four-digit code printed on the lid. For a list of codes subject to the recall, see the FDA release.
