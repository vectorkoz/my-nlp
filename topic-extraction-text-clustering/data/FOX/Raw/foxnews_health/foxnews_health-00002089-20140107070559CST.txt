Urban Outfitters is under fire for an offensive piece of clothing.
The controversy is over a women's T-shirt with the word "Depression."
Urban pulled the shirt from its stores and reduced the price to only 9.99 on its website after shoppers complained the shirt was making light of a serious disease.
The shirt was actually made by a company named "depression."
A lot of people on twitter called the shirt distasteful.
One person tweeted, "Absolutely disgusting what Urban Outfitters is selling. Disgraceful. I don't know how that is allowed."
