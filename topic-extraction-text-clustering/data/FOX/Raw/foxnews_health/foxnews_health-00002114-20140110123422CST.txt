Do you remember the "thigh gap" trend? Well, now there is a thing called the "bikini bridge."
The bikini bridge is when a woman is so skinny her hip bones lift the front of her bikini up when she lies down.
The hashtag "bikini bridge" is now trending on twitter and 4chan, and there's even a tumbler page where women are uploading photos.
Body image experts are calling it another unhealthy trend that women will obsess about in their quest to be thin. A buzzfeed page was also created to make fun of this need trend. The author quips, "Harry Styles will be 857 per cent more attracted to you."
