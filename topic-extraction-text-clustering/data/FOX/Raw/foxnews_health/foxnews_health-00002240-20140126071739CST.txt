The Texas hospital that has kept a brain-dead pregnant woman alive against her family's wishes says it will comply with Friday's court ruling to end life support for Marlise Munoz.
John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth said today in a statement that its role is "not to make nor contest law but to follow it," reports the AP.
The hospital had until 5pm tomorrow to comply or file an appeal, notes the Star-Telegram. Munoz, who is 23 weeks pregnant with a "distinctly abnormal" fetus, has been hospitalized and on life support since before Thanksgiving.
