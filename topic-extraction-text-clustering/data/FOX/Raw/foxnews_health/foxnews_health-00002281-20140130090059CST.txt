For many of us, Super Bowl Sunday means Super Bowl snack day. And let’s be honest, no big game bash is complete without a solid spread of crunchy, salty and cheesy snacks. According to the Calorie Control Council, the average Super Bowl watcher consumes 1,200 calories during the broadcast. But, just because there's a big game doesn’t mean you have to consume big calories. Traditional game-day foods like chips, dips, pizza and sandwiches are crowd pleasers, but they can be some of the worst foods for you, health-wise. Follow these tips and guilt-free swaps to help you master the art of Super Bowl Survival. Stock up on smart snacks Kick-off isn’t complete without a crunch. Chips and pretzels are a staple at just about every Super Bowl spread, but you can easily cut calories while still getting the crunch you crave with smart and easy swaps. Restaurant-style tortilla chips vs. Guiltless Gourmet Yellow Corn Tortilla Chips Swap your calorie-ridden chips for Guiltless Gourmet Yellow Corn Tortilla Chips. They have nearly half the fat of traditional tortilla chips, and they pair perfectly with salsa. A big handful of 18 chips has only 120 calories and 3 grams of fat. Greasy potato chips vs. Popchips Instead of the traditional potato chips that leave your hands all oily, try popped chips. These chips combine potato with other ingredients like rice and corn, and they come in tons of flavors. With around half the fat of regular potato chips and only 120 calories in 16 - 23 chips, this swap is perfect for any game-obsessed fan. Fatty Dips vs. Eat Well Enjoy Life Sweet & Spicy Black Bean Hummus Give your guests something other than chips and dips to snack on, and put out a tray of carrots and hummus. A great option is Eat Well Enjoy Life’s Sweet & Spicy Black Bean Hummus that has a tasty little spice kick with just 40 calories and 1.5 grams of fat in each serving. But, when you’re buying hummus, you should read the labels carefully, as many brands secretly hide a lot of fat and calories. Mealtime dishes: Load up on the filling stuff Even though we try to eat healthy stuff, we’re bound to indulge on some of our favorite guilty pleasures during the big game. To help reduce your calorie intake, try munching on more protein packed dishes, and plan to make a few of your favorites yourself so you can swap in some healthier ingredients. Deli sandwiches vs. StarKist Tuna Creations® Instead of a traditional New York deli sub that packs on layers of pastrami, whole fat cheeses and mayo spreads, use a lean protein that still packs on a big flavor. Tuna is one of my go-to protein swaps. It's an awesome lean protein that really helps to keep you satisfied. Try my Hungry Girl Tuna Bacon Ranch Wrap. You just need a pouch of StarKist Tuna Creations, fat-free ranch dressing, crumbled bacon and medium high-fiber tortilla. This recipe has bacon and has still only 6 grams of fat. New York-style pizza vs. homemade pizza One slice of New York cheese pizza can set you back at least 400 to 500 calories. So skip the take-out and make yours at home. Pizza is super simple to make at home. Just grab a package of refrigerated pizza crust dough, roll it out and top with your favorites. Try this recipe for a cheesy alternative that will give you an extra fiber boost from broccoli: Rockin’ Broccoli Garlic Pizza Hot dogs vs. fat free hot dogs You can’t walk the streets of NYC without getting a hot dog, but these puppies are loaded with crazy amounts of fats and calories. Even turkey or chicken dogs can have as many fat grams as a beef dog. If you really want a beef dog during your Super Bowl soiree, Hebrew National 97 Percent Fat Free Hot Dogs have only 40 calories and 1 gram of fat . Try this recipe for a flaky-licious hot dog treat that taste almost exactly like real pigs in a blanket De-Pudged Pigs In A Blanket Desserts Fatty desserts, like cookies and cupcakes, are always found at Super Bowl parties. Since the big game is in the NYC area this year, you’ll want to head to Little Italy to get a classic cannoli. But those little gems can really tackle you with a lot of sugar and fat.     Italian cannoli vs. cannoli cones I’ve made my own take on this classic dessert that is perfect for the end of the party. So to cut your sugar and fat intake, try my Holy Moly Cannoli Cones. With smarter ingredients, you’ll take much less of a calorie hit!
