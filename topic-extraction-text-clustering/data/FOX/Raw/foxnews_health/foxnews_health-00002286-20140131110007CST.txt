For multiple sclerosis (MS) sufferers, symptoms like numbness, fatigue and difficulty walking can be debilitating – but changing what they eat can have a big impact on the quality of their lives.
The National MS Society website advises a diet that’s low in saturated fats and high in omega-3 fatty acids.
A two-year study of 312 MS patients revealed that people who ingested 10 grams of fish oil each day had less progression of the debilitating disease than those who did not take supplements.
You can take a supplement, but it is always a good idea to incorporate whole foods into your diet.
Walnuts, flaxseed and cod liver oil are excellent sources of omega-3 fatty acids, as well as fatty fish such as salmon. 
According to the National MS Society, three grams of omega-3 fatty acids per day is considered safe, but you should talk to your doctor before making any changes to your diet.
