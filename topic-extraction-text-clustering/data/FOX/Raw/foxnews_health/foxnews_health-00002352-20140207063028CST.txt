Big Food is ditching risky ingredients: Kraft removed Yellow Nos. 5 and 6 from some of its mac and cheeses, and Gatorade got rid of brominated vegetable oil (here's a list of the 10 most improved foods that have kicked sketchy ingredients to the curb). But there's still a ways to go.
We'd love to see more food folks quit the following chemicals.
Artificial food dyes
Petroleum-based dyes such as Blue No. 2 and Yellow No. 5 are banned elsewhere for their potential roles in hyperactivity and cancer. Pick foods naturally colored by beets and turmeric; organics are a safe bet. 
To avoid the most pesticide-ridden produce items, check out these 5 Foods You Should Always Buy Organic.
Brominated vegetable oil
BVO contains bromine—a compound found in flame retardants—and is linked to memory problems. It's used as an emulsifier in some sodas, sports drinks, and juices, so check ingredient lists. 
Is your diet soda habit making you fat? Check out these 7 nasty side effects of diet soda.
Caramel coloring
It's made by heating sugars, often with ammonia, and the state of California has labeled one of its compounds a carcinogen. Opt for natural brown dyes like annatto extract.
Butylated hydroxyanisole
This petroleum-derived packaged-food preservative is a probable carcinogen. But some spices adequately replace BHA, so there may be hope for a preservative-free future.
