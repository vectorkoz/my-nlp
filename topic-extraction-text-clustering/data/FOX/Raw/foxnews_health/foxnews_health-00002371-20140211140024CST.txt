For men with receding hairlines, baldness can be a major concern. And although there is nothing you can do to prevent going bald, there are some things you can do now to slow your hair loss.
Male pattern baldness is related to genes, and nothing can be done to prevent this common condition..
According to the American Academy of Dermatology, two out of three men develop some form of balding during their lifetimes.
And – heredity is not the only cause. Other factors include: • Certain medications • Deficiencies in your diet • Stress
Managing stress levels will help to stop hair loss as major life stressors can actually cause your hair to die.
Look at your prescriptions, too. They could be making you go bald. Certain blood thinners and psychiatric drugs have been known have been known to have this side effect.
You can also eat foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids like salmon and walnuts.
These foods are packed with protein and minerals, which has been linked to hair loss prevention in chemotherapy patients. Also, try incorporating foods high in iron and vitamin B if you are deficient.
You can always visit a dermatologist for more solutions if you are concerned about hair loss.
