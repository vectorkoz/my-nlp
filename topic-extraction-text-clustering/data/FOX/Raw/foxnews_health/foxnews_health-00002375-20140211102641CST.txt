Chocolate prompts the release of the mood-boosting hormone serotonin as well as the amino acid phenylethylamine, which increases alertness … and passion. Just be sure to choose antioxidant-rich dark chocolate – look for one that lists natural cocoa powder high among its ingredients. Natural cocoa powder is known to be especially high in antioxidants, which may lower the risk of some cancers, stoke, and heart disease.
Oysters have long been considered the food of love and legend has it that Casanova ate dozens of oysters each day.  Oysters are rich in the mineral zinc, which is associated with male fertility, potency and sex drive. The health benefits associated with zinc are equal opportunity, though, as zinc promotes healthy metabolism and a healthy immune system. The daily requirement for zinc is 11mg for men and 9mg for females, and eating just two cooked oysters (11mg zinc) will give you enough.   
Strawberries have been touted as an aphrodisiac fruit since ancient Roman days when the heart-shaped strawberry was a symbol of Venus, the goddess of love. In France, the age-old tradition of serving newlyweds cold strawberry soup is said to ensure a romantic honeymoon. It’s also said that breaking a strawberry in half and sharing it brings love. Strawberries are can help you keep your sexy curves because they are low in calories, (1 ¼ cup contains only 60 calories) and high in fiber (5g per serving) – a sweet treat that fills you up, not out. Strawberries are rich in biotin, too, which builds strong hair and nails.
Hot spices such as cayenne, curry and cumin can make you feel amorous because they warm and relax the body.  Capsaicin, the compound that gives chili peppers their fiery kick, does this while also increasing heart rate and triggering the release of mood-enhancing endorphins. Capsaicin is helpful for weight control because it revs up metabolism and satisfies appetite with smaller spicy portions.
Pine nuts are sexier than your average nut. A half cup serving contains a whopping 9g of muscle building protein and eating them can help increase stamina.  Plus, pine nuts are rich in healthy monounsaturated fats (1/2 cup contains 13g), zinc and other nutrients thought to promote sexual desire.
