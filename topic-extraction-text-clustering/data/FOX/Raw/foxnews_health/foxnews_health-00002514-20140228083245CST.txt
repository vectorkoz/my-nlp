More and more Americans are opting to enhance their assets.
According to a new report from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS), 15.1 million cosmetic surgery procedures took place in the United States in 2013 – up 3 percent from the previous year.  
While breast augmentations and nose reshaping (rhinoplasty) are still the most popular surgical procedures, butt augmentations are also on the rise.  Nearly 10,000 procedures took place in 2013, an increase of 16 percent from 2012.  The report also noted that neck lifts have become very popular, as it is one of the first areas of the body to show a person’s age.  More than 55,000 neck procedures were performed in 2013.
ASPS President Dr. Robert Murphy said advancements in technology have ultimately paved the way for growth of the plastic surgery industry.
“The demand for plastic surgery remains strong, with our statistics showing increases in both cosmetic surgical and minimally-invasive procedures," Murphy said in a press release. "… With new devices and products hitting the market each year, there are more options and choices available to consumers wanting to refresh their look or a little nip and tuck."
Overall, reconstructive surgery procedures increased last year; 5.7 million of these surgeries were performed, increasing by 2 percent from 2012.  
Breast reconstruction surgeries have also been on the rise, a trend Murphy said is especially encouraging for breast cancer patients.
"It's promising to see breast reconstruction rates rising," Murphy said. "Less than 20 percent of breast cancer patients undergo breast reconstruction because they are not always informed of their options, although studies show that reconstruction greatly improves quality of life.”
