Fat keeps you warm, regulates your body function and stores energy.  But too much of a good thing can actually be bad.
It is well known that fat can lead to obesity and chronic diseases, but eating the right foods can help your body burn it.
Here are some to try:
Beans are filled with protein and fiber, which help you lose weight without feeling hungry. Fiber takes a long time to digest, so your body will be busy burning it off for a while.
Add eggs to your diet. Studies show people who eat them in the morning are more likely to drop pounds than people who eat carb-only breakfasts.
Bring on the avocados: They are packed with mono-unsaturated fats, which will lower your bad cholesterol. Your body will burn off avocados quickly, so they won’t stick to your hips.
Foods with omega-3s, like salmon, are vital for burning fat. They contain the hormone leptin, which directly affects your metabolism.
Also, add green tea to your shopping list. Studies show substances found in the drink will jump start your body to burn calories and fat.
