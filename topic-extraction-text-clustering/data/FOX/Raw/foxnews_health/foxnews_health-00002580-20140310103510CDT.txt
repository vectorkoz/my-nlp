A 2-year-old boy is being hailed a hero after using FaceTime to save his mother after she was gravely injured.
According to a report from KGUN, Laura Toone was trying to break up a fight between a foster dog she had been caring for and one of her own dogs -- when the foster dog bit part of her middle finger almost completely off.
Toone tried to dial 911 herself, but she said her hands were too bloody to make the call.
"I begged my daughters to call 911, and they're 4, and they were quite afraid to even touch the phone, because it was covered in my own blood from me trying to call 911," Toone, from Tuscan, Ariz., told KGUN.
The mother continued to lose significant amounts of blood and thought she was going to lose consciousness -- until her 2-year-old son Bentley showed up with a dish towel from the kitchen.  After wiping some of the blood off his mother's iPhone, Bentley proceeded to use FaceTime, a video chat app, to call Toone’s friend Connie Guerrero.
"All I could see was his little forehead, and I said 'Hi Bentley,' and it was quiet for a little bit. And then I hear Laura screaming," Guerrero told KGUN.
Guerrero then called 911, and Bentley unlocked the door to let firefighters into the house.  Toone told KGUN she is very thankful for her little hero and has since taught all of her children how to dial 911.
