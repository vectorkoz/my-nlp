A unlicensed beautician was charged Tuesday with killing a client with a botched butt-enhancement injection at a lower Manhattan hotel. Tamira Mobley, 28, didn’t speak as she was ordered held in lieu of $100,000 bail after being charged in Manhattan Criminal Court with manslaughter and felony assault for the July 8 death of Tamara Blaine, 22. Mobley — who has claimed to be a cosmetologist but is not licensed — left Blaine, a single mom from Queens, barely conscious on a bed in the Liberty Inn hotel after a clandestine meeting in which Mobley had promised to plump up Blaine’s behind, sources said. Mobley has other victims, authorities said — although none of them appears to have met the same fate as Blaine. “The defendant was running a small business [and ] we expect to have more charges,” Assistant District Attorney David Drucker said, noting that the additional charges would not include homicide.
