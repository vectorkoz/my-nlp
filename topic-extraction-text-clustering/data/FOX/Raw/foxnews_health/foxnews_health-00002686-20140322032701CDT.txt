BOSTON –  A young girl who lost part of her left leg in the Boston Marathon bombings has made great progress over the past 11 months, even as she and her family mourn her brother, who was killed in the attack.
A photo released by the family Friday shows Jane Richard, now 8, grinning widely while wearing a new prosthetic leg designed for running and everyday activities.
Jane is not self-conscious about her injury and has already worn the leg to school multiple times, the family said in a statement.
Jane's brother, 8-year-old Martin, was one of three people killed in the April 15 attack near the marathon finish line that injured more than 260. Their parents were also hurt.
"A day doesn't pass when we don't cry over the loss of Martin," the Richards said. "But we also laugh when we think about him, which feels like the right way to remember a little boy with a zest for life and a caring heart."
This year's marathon is April 21. About 100 runners have been selected to run as part of Team MR8, which will raise money for the foundation named in honor of Martin that invests in education, athletics and community.
