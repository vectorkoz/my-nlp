FOXBOROUGH, Mass. –  A defense that allowed 44 points in a playoff game might boost the confidence of its next opponent.
But the New England Patriots aren't counting on the Indianapolis Colts being that vulnerable again.
The Colts beat the Kansas City Chiefs 45-44 on Saturday in an AFC wild-card playoff game. On Saturday night, they'll visit the Patriots in a divisional round game.
Much of the focus in the Colts' win over the Chiefs went to quarterback Andrew Luck's comeback from a 38-10 third-quarter deficit. The defense that put Indianapolis in that hole got far less attention.
In the first half, the Chiefs marched 82, 79 and 77 yards to touchdowns and 68 yards to a field goal after kickoffs or punts.
