SAN DIEGO –  To keep their improbable playoff run going, the San Diego Chargers will have to beat Peyton Manning in January for the third time in seven seasons.
The Chargers won 27-10 at Cincinnati on Sunday to earn a shot at Manning and the top-seeded Denver Broncos on Sunday, the first time the AFC West rivals have met in the postseason.
When Manning was with Indianapolis, the Chargers eliminated the Colts from the playoffs in the 2007 and '08 seasons.
Manning has beaten the Chargers three of four times since joining the Broncos, although the Chargers pulled a shocker in Denver last month.
Says Pro Bowl safety Eric Weddle: "Do we believe we can win? Yes. Do we know what a tough challenge it is and how great we have to play? Yeah."
