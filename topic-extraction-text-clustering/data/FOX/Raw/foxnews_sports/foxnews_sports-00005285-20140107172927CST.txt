FOXBOROUGH, Mass. –  Tom Brady is still excited about the playoffs in his 14th season.
He shows that before games and after big plays by banging helmets with other New England Patriots. He says he's pretty emotional.
That should be on display Saturday night when he leads the Patriots against the Indianapolis Colts in an AFC divisional-round game, especially if the quarterback has plenty of scoring plays to celebrate.
His mood would be quite different if NFL sacks leader Robert Mathis keeps getting close enough to tackle him or hurry his passes.
Brady says Mathis has been a great player for a long time and is having one of the best seasons of his 11-year career.
