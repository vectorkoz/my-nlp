INDIANAPOLIS –  The Colts' defense is ready for its annual chess match with Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.
New England and Indy have played every year since 2003, three times in the playoffs, and Brady is 8-4 in those games. He has eliminated the Colts from the playoffs twice, missed one game in this series because of a knee injury and last year celebrated a 59-24 thumping that is still Andrew Luck's worst loss as a pro.
But when the longtime rivals meet in Saturday's divisional-round playoff game, Brady will be missing three receivers from his old cast — Rob Gronkowski, Aaron Hernandez and Wes Welker.
Indy (12-5) still sees Brady getting the ball to playmakers, making all the right moves and winning games for the Patriots (12-4).
