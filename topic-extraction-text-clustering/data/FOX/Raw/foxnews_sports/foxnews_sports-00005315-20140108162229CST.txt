GREEN BAY, Wis. –  Packers coach Mike McCarthy's offseason started way too early for his liking.
Three days after the San Francisco 49ers ended their season, the Packers are already looking ahead to 2014. For all the strengths on offense, it's the defense that again needs a tuneup.
McCarthy said Wednesday at his season-ending news conference that he's looking for impact players on defense. He says he think some of those guys are already on the team, but the question is whether more need to join them.
Assistants will be evaluated in the next few weeks, though it doesn't sound like McCarthy is planning any drastic changes. Defensive coordinator Dom Capers, who is under heat from some fans, says he has no plans of not coaching next year.
