FOXBOROUGH, Mass. –  Logan Mankins got tough working with his dad on a cattle ranch in California. Getting kicked by a steer was just part of the job.
And no reason to take a day off.
That upbringing helped prepare him for a profession that brought more serious pain, left guard for the New England Patriots. And that couldn't stop him either.
Mankins missed only one series after hurting his left ankle Dec. 29 in a 34-20 victory over the Buffalo Bills. Even coach Bill Belichick was surprised at his speedy return after being helped off the field.
Now Mankins is preparing to face the Indianapolis Colts in an AFC divisional-round playoff game Saturday night.
