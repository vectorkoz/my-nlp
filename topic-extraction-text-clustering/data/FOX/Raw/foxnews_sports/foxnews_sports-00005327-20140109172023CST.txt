HONOLULU –  Sang-Moon Bae made seven birdies in pristine conditions along the shores of Oahu for a bogey-free 63 and the early lead Thursday in the Sony Open.
Bae needed every one of them to stay ahead of Chris Kirk, who is in his group.
Kirk rallied for a 29 on the back nine of Waialae Country Club and was one shot behind among the early starters in the first full-field event of the year. Bae and Kirk had a better-ball score of 56.
Both opened 2014 on Maui last week in the Tournament of Champions.
John Daly was in the group at 66. Adam Scott, with surfer Benji Weatherly taking over as his caddie this week, was in the group at 67.
