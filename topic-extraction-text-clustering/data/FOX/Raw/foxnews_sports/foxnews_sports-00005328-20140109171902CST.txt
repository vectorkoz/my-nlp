ENGLEWOOD, Colo. –  John Elway followed up possibly the best free agent signing in NFL history — Peyton Manning — with another jackpot this season.
Wes Welker and Louis Vasquez helped transform the Broncos offense into the highest-scoring team in the Super Bowl era, and a bevy of defensive signings helped rescue a unit that was hit hard by injuries and illness.
Vasquez, a fifth-year right guard lured from AFC West rival San Diego, earned All-Pro and Pro Bowl honors after anchoring an offensive line that allowed the fewest sacks in the NFL (20) this season and produced a league-high six games without allowing a quarterback takedown.
