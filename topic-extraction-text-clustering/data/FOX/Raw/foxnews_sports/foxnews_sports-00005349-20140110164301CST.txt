Former North Carolina player P.J. Hairston says he will play in the NBA Development League.
In a statement, Hairston said he submitted paperwork to play in the league Friday afternoon. He also said he is taking an online course through UNC toward his communications major and turned in his first assignment Thursday.
The Tar Heels' leading scorer never played this season after the school decided last month not to seek his reinstatement for NCAA rules violations, including using rental vehicles tied to a felon and party promoter in Durham.
Hairston said in his statement he is "excited to continue to pursue my degree at UNC while also pursuing my dream of becoming a professional basketball player."
The 21-year-old flirted with entering the NBA draft before returning for his junior season.
