PHILADELPHIA –  Shaq Goodwin had 23 points and 11 rebounds to lead No. 24 Memphis to a 79-69 win over Temple on Saturday.
Down four early in the second half, Memphis (12-3, 3-1 American) used a 17-6 run lasting nearly seven minutes to finally pull away and successfully follow up its win at No. 12 Louisville on Thursday. Memphis is only the second ranked team to win at Temple in the past six seasons. Then No. 1 Kansas topped the Owls in the 2009-10 season.
The Owls led 49-48 with 13:46 to play but came undone after switching to a zone defense out of a timeout. After air-balling its first attempt against the zone, Memphis hit three quick threes to spark a run and take a 10-point lead with 6:55 remaining.
Dalton Pepper scored 24 to lead Temple.
