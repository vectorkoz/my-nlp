DENVER –  San Diego linebacker Manti Te'o and punter Mike Scifres were shaken up late in the first half of Sunday's AFC divisional playoff game against the Denver Broncos.
The Chargers had no immediate update on their conditions or if they would return.
Te'o was hurt trying to tackle running back Knowshon Moreno near the goal line. The rookie linebacker went into the locker room for evaluation.
Scifres was banged up trying to make a tackle on Eric Decker's long punt return. Scifres stayed down for several minutes before being helped to the sideline.
