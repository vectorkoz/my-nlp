WASHINGTON –  Cody Hodgson decided a lackluster game with the only goal in the shootout, and the Buffalo Sabres avoided matching the longest road losing streak in franchise history with a 2-1 win over the Washington Capitals on Sunday.
Hodgson, returning after missing eight games with a hand injury, beat Philipp Grubauer in a skills contest that mirrored the rest of the game — not many quality chances, hardly any pucks in the net.
Tyler Ennis scored in the first period, and Ryan Miller made 28 saves for the Sabres, whose 11-game road skid was the second-longest in club history, behind a 12-game streak in the 2011-12 season.
Jason Chimera also scored in the opening period, and Grubauer made 30 saves for the Capitals, who have lost five of seven.
