SAN DIEGO –  The San Diego Chargers can feel good about overachieving and making it to the divisional playoffs when hardly anyone thought they'd make the postseason under rookie coach Mike McCoy.
They also go into the offseason kicking themselves a bit over lost opportunities.
Sunday's 24-17 loss at Denver was a microcosm of their season — a slow start following by a frantic finish. This time, though, it wasn't enough and Peyton Manning and the Broncos held on to avenge their only home loss of the regular season.
San Diego won its final four regular season games — and five of six — to sneak into the playoffs before winning a wild-card game at Cincinnati.
Says Pro Bowl safety Eric Weddle: "We were a force to be reckoned with at the end of the year."
