LA QUINTA, Calif. –  The perfect weather, mountain views and low scores remain. Little else at the Humana Challenge resembles the event's glory days.
The old Bob Hope Classic was Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack, T-bone steaks and late-night cocktails. The Humana Challenge — actually, the Humana Challenge in partnership with the Clinton Foundation — is corporate executives, carrot sticks and early morning power walks.
The tournament has done away with the celebrity portion of the pro-am field, though Craig T. Nelson, Michael Bolton, Arizona Cardinals kicker Jay Feely and Golf Channel's Holly Sonders are playing as "special guests."
The field also is thin on star power, with Kapalua winner Zach Johnson, at No. 6, the top-ranked player.
