DETROIT –  Jim Caldwell's body of work helped him get a second opportunity to be an NFL coach.
Of course, there was that call from Peyton Manning, too.
Detroit Lions general manager Martin Mayhew says the Denver Broncos quarterback called him — unsolicited — during the team's search to throw support behind his former coach with the Indianapolis Colts.
Caldwell was introduced Wednesday as the Lions' new coach, saying the time to win is now.
Detroit is giving the former Baltimore Ravens offensive coordinator a four-year contract in part to get the most out of Matthew Stafford. The QB led the league in turnovers during a late-season slide that knocked the Lions out of the playoff picture and cost Jim Schwartz his job after five years.
