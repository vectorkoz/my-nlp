ENGLEWOOD, Colo. –  Peyton Manning's road to the Super Bowl has taken an unexpected detour. Through Omaha, of all places.
On Wednesday, Manning pretended to shed a bit of light on his new favorite city, the name of which he shouted out 44 times from the line of scrimmage during Denver's playoff win over San Diego last weekend.
The Broncos quarterback says, "It's a run play, but it could be a pass play, or a play-action pass, depending on a couple of things."
Hardly any clues there for the New England Patriots, who travel to Denver on Sunday. The winner heads to the Meadowlands as the AFC representative in the Super Bowl.
