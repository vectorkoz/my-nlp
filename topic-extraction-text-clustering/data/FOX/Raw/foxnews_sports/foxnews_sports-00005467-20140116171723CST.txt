ANAHEIM, Calif. –  By the time the Anaheim Ducks finished with them late Wednesday night, the Canucks had a humiliating 9-1 loss and four players in the dressing room after committing misconduct penalties out of frustration.
As beleaguered Vancouver can attest, it's an awfully tough time to face the Ducks. They reign atop the NHL at 36-8-5 after winning 18 of their last 19 games, including eight straight.
It's even tougher to visit Honda Center, where Anaheim has gone 20-0-2 to match the NHL's longest season-opening home points streak in 34 years.
With four quality scoring lines, a versatile defense and standout goaltending from Jonas Hiller, the Ducks have been the NHL's best team.
And every Anaheim player realizes it means nothing without the playoff success that has eluded them since 2007.
