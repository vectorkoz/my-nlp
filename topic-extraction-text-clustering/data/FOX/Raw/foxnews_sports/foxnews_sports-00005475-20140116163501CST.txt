OAKLAND, Calif. –  Golden State Warriors general manager Bob Myers believes he has put together a roster that has a real chance to win the NBA title. He also knows so much has to go Golden State's way between now and June for that to happen.
The streaky Warriors (25-15) will hit the season's halfway point Friday night at Oklahoma City, and they're still as tough as any team to figure out. Golden State has shown it has the potential to achieve the league's ultimate prize — or just as easily fall far short.
Golden State is 20-5 when its regulars — Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala, David Lee and Andrew Bogut — are in the starting lineup. But there are still troubling trends with turnovers and a lack of bench production.
