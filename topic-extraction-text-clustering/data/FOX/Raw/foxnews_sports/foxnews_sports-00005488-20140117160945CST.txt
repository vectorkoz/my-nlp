DURHAM, N.C. –  Duke says point guard Chelsea Gray has had surgery on her right knee.
The school said Gray underwent the procedure Friday to repair the kneecap she broke Jan. 12 in a win against Boston College.
The senior was hurt during the first half of the third-ranked Blue Devils' victory over BC. The injury was initially thought to be a bruised thigh.
It was the same knee she injured last February.
Gray was averaging 10.8 points, 7.2 assists and 2.9 steals when she suffered her season-ending injury. Her college career ends 35 assists shy of the school record.
