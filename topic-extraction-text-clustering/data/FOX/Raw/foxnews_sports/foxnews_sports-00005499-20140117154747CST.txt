ENGLEWOOD, Colo. –  The highlight reel for Champ Bailey doesn't run long.
For the first 14 years, it was because quarterbacks didn't throw his way and there weren't many plays to make.
For the last four months, it was because he's barely been on the field.
And nowhere among any of it is there a clip of him playing in a Super Bowl.
The Denver Broncos can help him change that Sunday. But if they beat the Patriots and Bailey finally makes it to the big show, he won't consider himself having filled in the last missing piece of his resume, even if others do.
Says the 15th-year cornerback: "I don't worry about my legacy. All those things will take care of themselves."
