Javan Felix scored 17 for Texas, including a big 3-pointer in the momentum-changing run in the second half.
Georges Niang scored 18 to lead Iowa State, which started the season 14-0. The Cyclones (14-3, 2-3) hadn't lost three in a row since the 2010-2011 season and haven't won in Austin since 2005.
