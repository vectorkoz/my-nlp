LA QUINTA, Calif. –  Another perfect day in the Coachella Valley. Another 9-under 63 for Patrick Reed in the Humana Challenge.
Reed broke the PGA Tour record for relation to par in the first three rounds of a tournament, finishing at 27-under Saturday to take a seven-stroke lead into the final round.
He birdied his final hole on PGA West's Jack Nicklaus Private Course, hitting a wedge to 2 feet on the par-4 ninth. He also had an eagle, eight birdies and a bogey.
Reed broke the tour mark of 25-under set by Gay Brewer in the 1967 Pensacola Open and matched by Ernie Els in the 2003 Tournament of Champions, Steve Stricker in the 2010 John Deere Classic and Pat Perez in the 2009 event in La Quinta. Reed was one off Stricker's stroke record of 188 set on a par-71 course.
