AUBURN, Ala. –  Casey Prather scored 21 points in his return from a knee injury and helped No. 7 Florida survive a scare from Auburn in a 68-61 victory on Saturday.
Prather had 16 points in the first half after missing the past two games with a badly bruised right knee. He made 8 of 10 shots for the Gators (15-2, 4-0 Southeastern Conference), who have won nine straight games and eight in a row at Auburn (8-7, 0-4).
Tahj Shamsid-Deen hit a jump shot with 1:59 left to cut Florida's lead to 62-61, but Scottie Wilbekin answered with a fadeaway jumper. Wilbekin made 2 of 4 free throws over the final 48 seconds.
Patric Young blocked KT Harrell's attempt to bring Auburn to within two points in between those trips to the line.
Wilbekin finished with 16 points. Chris Denson led Auburn with 21.
