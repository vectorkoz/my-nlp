AUBURN HILLS, Mich. –  The Detroit Pistons are in position to make the playoffs, but they've still been one of the NBA's most perplexing teams this season.
Detroit is 17-23, only two games better than at this point in 2012-13. That's good enough for a spot among the top eight teams in the Eastern Conference right now, but after the Pistons added Josh Smith and Brandon Jennings in the offseason, fans were hoping for more.
There was always going to be an adjustment period after so many significant changes — new coach Maurice Cheeks was also added during the offseason. But this season is now about half over, and it's fair to wonder if this new-look roster will need another makeover before the stretch run.
