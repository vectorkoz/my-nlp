LAWRENCE, Kan. –  Chelsea Gardner scored 28 points and Natalie Knight added 18 as Kansas upset No. 7 Baylor 76-60 Sunday.
CeCe Harper added 10 points for Kansas (9-9. 2-4 Big 12), which defeated Baylor for the first time in nine games.
Odyssey Sims scored 31 points for the Bears (14-2, 4-1), but she was held to only 10 points in the second half as the Bears struggled shooting.
Niya Johnson added eight points for Baylor.
Sims made only 4 of 19 shots in the second half, and without her the Bears couldn't do much offensively.
Kansas took control of the game in the final 10 minutes. After Baylor took a 45-44 lead, Kansas went on a 32-15 run the rest of the game, highlighted by a layup and free throw from Harper to put Kansas up 12 with four minutes left.
