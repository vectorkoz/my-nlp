BOSTON –  Brad Marchand continued his recent hot scoring stretch with a pair of goals Monday, lifting the Boston Bruins to a 3-2 win over the Los Angeles Kings.
Marchand, who also had two in Boston's shootout loss in Chicago on Sunday, has scored six in his past four games. Torey Krug had the other goal for the Bruins, who won at home for the 11th time in 13 games.
Boston's backup goaltender Chad Johnson made 21 saves.
Willie Mitchell and Jeff Carter scored for the Kings. Jonathan Quick stopped 20 shots.
Los Angeles has lost two straight, but collected points in six of eight (4-2-2).
Marchand scored 18 seconds after Los Angeles had tied the game when he one-timed Patrice Bergeron's pass inside the right post by Quick's glove.
