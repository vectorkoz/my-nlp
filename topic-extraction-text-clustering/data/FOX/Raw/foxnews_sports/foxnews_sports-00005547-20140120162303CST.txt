NEW YORK –  Joe Johnson scored 25 points and the Brooklyn Nets sent the Knicks to a fourth straight loss with a 103-80 victory Monday, evening this season's New York rivalry at a game apiece.
Making a triumphant return from London, the Nets improved to 7-1 in 2014 and avenged last month's blowout loss with a romp of their own.
Andray Blatche had 19 points and 12 rebounds, and Alan Anderson scored 15 points for the Nets.
Deron Williams finished with 13 points in his return from a five-game absence, coach Jason Kidd opting to bring him off the bench rather than break up a starting lineup of Johnson, Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, Shaun Livingston and Anderson that is 5-0.
Carmelo Anthony had 26 points and 12 rebounds for the Knicks.
