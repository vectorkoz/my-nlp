ATLANTA –  Atlanta Hawks center Pero Antic has a stress fracture in his right ankle and is expected to miss two to four weeks.
The loss of Antic leaves the Hawks thin on their front line as they prepare to play San Antonio on Friday night. Antic has been Atlanta's primary replacement for Al Horford, who was lost for the season when he tore his right pectoral muscle on Dec. 26.
Antic suffered a mild right ankle sprain in the Hawks' loss to the Nets in London on Jan. 16. A follow-up examination in Atlanta on Thursday revealed the stress fracture. Antic was placed in a protective walking boot.
Forward DeMarre Carroll left Wednesday night's win in Orlando with a mild strain to his left hamstring. His status is day to day.
