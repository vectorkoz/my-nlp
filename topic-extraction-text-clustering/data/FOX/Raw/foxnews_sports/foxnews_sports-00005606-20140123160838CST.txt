SAO PAULO –  Landon Donovan says the United States has never played a World Cup with such an experienced group of players as it will have in Brazil, giving the Americans a "real chance" to do well next June.
As the U.S. finalizes a week-and-a-half training camp in Brazil, Donovan said American players have enough confidence and experience to confront more traditional World Cup teams heading into a first round that includes matches against Germany, Portugal and Ghana.
The midfielder said Thursday players are convinced it's possible to "get results against them, and that's a nice feeling going into a World Cup."
The 31-year-old said "we feel good about where we are at."
