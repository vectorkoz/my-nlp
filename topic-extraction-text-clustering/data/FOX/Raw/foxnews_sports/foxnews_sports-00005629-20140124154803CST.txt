PORTLAND, Ore. –  Sure, LaMarcus Aldridge was bummed he wasn't named an All-Star starter. But he wasn't nearly as upset as his teammates. Or his mom.
While he acknowledged disappointment after the game, Aldridge let his play answer any skeptics Thursday night when he scored a career-high 44 points in Portland's 110-105 come-from-behind victory over the Denver Nuggets. He scored the final 15 points of the game, prompting chants of "M-V-P!" from the Portland fans.
His scoring outburst came just a few hours after the All-Star starters, based on fan voting, were announced. Aldridge came in fifth place in the West: The starting frontcourt includes Oklahoma City's Kevin Durant, the Clippers' Blake Griffin and Minnesota's Kevin Love.
Wesley Matthews was among those miffed about the selection, calling Aldridge the best power forward in the game.
