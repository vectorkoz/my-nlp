WALTHAM, Mass. –  Paul Pierce might have trouble finding the visitors' locker room or controlling his emotions in his return to Boston.
But beating the Celtics should be the easy part.
Pierce and Kevin Garnett will face their former team on their old home court for the first time Sunday night since the blockbuster trade that sent them to the Brooklyn Nets on draft night.
Pierce is the Celtics' former captain who spent all 15 of his previous seasons with Boston. Garnett was there for the last six. They were traded as part of the Celtics' rebuilding project. The Nets are on a roll with nine wins in their last 10 games. The Celtics have lost 16 of their last 19.
