CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. –  Malcolm Brogdon scored 18 points, Joe Harris had 12 and streaking Virginia closed the first half on a 21-6 run and cruised to its fourth straight victory against Virginia Tech, 65-45, on Saturday.
The Cavaliers (15-5, 6-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) matched their best start in conference play in 31 years. In all six of their ACC victories, they have led by at least 20 points in the second half.
Devin Wilson scored 12 to lead the Hokies (8-11, 1-6), who lost their sixth in a row. The Hokies again played without Adam Smith, their No. 3 scorer (11 ppg), who is out with a strained left calf.
Virginia Tech scored seven of the first nine points after halftime to get within 36-24, but Virginia responded by pushing its lead as high as 23 and coach Tony Bennett substituted liberally at the finish.
