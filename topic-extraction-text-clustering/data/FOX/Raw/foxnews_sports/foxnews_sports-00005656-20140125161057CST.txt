WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. –  Devin Thomas scored 21 points and Wake Forest beat Notre Dame 65-58 on Saturday.
Travis McKie finished with 14 points and Codi Miller-McIntyre added six of his eight in the final 2 minutes for the Demon Deacons (14-6, 4-3 Atlantic Coast Conference).
Garrick Sherman scored 20 points but the Fighting Irish (11-9, 2-5) were denied their first ACC road victory.
Sherman's free throw with 2:24 left put Notre Dame up 54-53 before Miller-McIntyre gave the Demon Deacons the lead for good with an across-the-lane drive with just under 2 minutes left.
After Pat Connaughton missed a 3-pointer, Miller-McIntyre added two free throws with 1:26 left to give Wake Forest a 57-54 lead. The sophomore guard then followed Sherman's layup with a jumper to put the Demon Deacons up 59-56 with 46.4 seconds remaining.
