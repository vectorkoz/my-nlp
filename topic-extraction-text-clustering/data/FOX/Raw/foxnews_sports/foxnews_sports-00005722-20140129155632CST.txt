The San Antonio Spurs say Manu Ginobili will miss the next three to four weeks with a strained left hamstring.
Ginobili had an MRI exam on Wednesday, one day after he was injured while dunking the ball in a loss to the Houston Rockets. The 36-year-old Ginobili threw down a big, one-handed slam, but had to leave the game shortly after while grabbing his hamstring.
Ginobili missed two games earlier in January with the same injury and is the latest in a long line of Spurs to miss time this season. Kawhi Leonard, Danny Green and Tiago Splitter are all out with injuries.
The Spurs hope to get Splitter back before they leave for their annual rodeo road trip.
Ginobili is averaging 12.1 points and 4.5 assists this season.
