ROCHESTER, Mich. –  Oakland University's Travis Bader needs eight 3-pointers to surpass J.J. Redick's career mark of 457, the most by a Division I player.
Although he hasn't been at his best lately, Bader is still appreciative of the spotlight that comes with his pursuit of a major national record.
The sharp-shooting senior has been in a slump lately. Bader is 12 of 53 from 3-point range over his past five games. Still, the Golden Grizzlies have enough games remaining that the record should come in time.
He made five 3-pointers against Illinois-Chicago on Saturday, so perhaps his shooting stroke is returning with a home game against Youngstown State coming up Friday night.
