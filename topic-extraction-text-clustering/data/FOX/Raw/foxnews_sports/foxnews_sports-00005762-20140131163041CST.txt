RICHMOND, Va. –  Richmond's city rivalry with VCU has taken on new meaning in the past two seasons with both teams now competing in the Atlantic 10 Conference, and Saturday's meeting at VCU comes at a good time for the Spiders.
Richmond is coming off a 20-point loss at No. 19 Saint Louis that was never that close.
Coach Chris Mooney says having the Spiders' rival next on the schedule is probably a good thing because it's a game the team circles when it gets the schedule. The Spiders also know they can't afford to let the loss to the Billikens linger with the Rams waiting on Saturday morning.
Scoring leader Cedrick Lindsay says the loss at Saint Louis was a wakeup call.
