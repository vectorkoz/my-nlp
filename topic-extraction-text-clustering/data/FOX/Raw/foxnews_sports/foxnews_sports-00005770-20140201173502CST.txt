AUSTIN, Texas –  Isaiah Taylor scored 23 points, Jonathan Holmes had 22 and No. 25 Texas rolled over No. 6 Kansas 81-69 on Saturday for its sixth consecutive victory.
Texas, which lost its top four scorers from last year's 16-18 squad, has been the surprise of the Big 12. The Longhorns have four consecutive wins over Top 25 opponents and now sit in second place after dominating a team that had been playing as well as anyone in the country in recent weeks.
The Longhorns (17-4, 6-2) thumped the Jayhawks (16-5, 7-1) with suffocating defense that held the Big 12's best shooting team to 39 percent from the floor. Kansas freshman Andrew Wiggins, who averaged 24 points over the previous three games, scored seven before fouling out late.
