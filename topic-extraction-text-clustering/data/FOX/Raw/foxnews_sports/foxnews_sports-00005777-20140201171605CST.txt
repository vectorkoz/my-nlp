AMES, Iowa –  Sophomore Georges Niang scored a career-high 27 points and No. 16 Iowa State held off 23rd-ranked Oklahoma 81-75 on Saturday for just its second win in six games.
Melvin Ejim had 22 points with 16 rebounds for his 28th double-double as the Cyclones (16-4, 4-4 Big 12) moved back to .500 in the Big 12.
Oklahoma had pulled within three points when Niang buried a 3 to put Iowa Stata ahead 76-70 with 55.5 second left.
Buddy Hield scored a career-high 30 points for Oklahoma (17-5, 6-3), which saw its winning streak snapped at four games. The Sooners lost despite outrebounding Iowa State 46-33.
After four losses in five games, Iowa State coach Fred Hoiberg made a big change to his lineup.
Hoiberg gave freshman Monte Morris his first start at point guard after he posted a 20-to-2 assist to turnover ratio in seven Big 12 games. The move also allowed the Cyclones to free up Kane, the team's second-leading scorer at nearly 17 points a game, for more opportunities to make plays from the wing.
Kane matched a season-low with five points. But Kane added nine assists, and his dunk with 33 seconds to go helped put away the Sooners.
Morris had 12 points but just one assist.
But the guard who dominated the game early was Hield.
He had 18 points in just 20 minutes — including his fourth 3 of the half to give Oklahoma a 33-32 lead. Ryan Spangler then hit a 3 that was later ruled a 2 following a video replay, and the team went into halftime tied at 37.
Hield matched his previous best of 23 points with 16:08 left, then hit a layup to tie the game at 46-all on Oklahoma's next trip down the floor.
But Iowa State tightened up its defense on Hield and freshman Matt Thomas — who looked lost at times earlier this season — confidently drilled a 25-footer that gave Iowa State's its first double-digit lead, 62-52.
Hield and the Sooners wouldn't go away though, as he hit a pair of free throws to make it 69-68 with 2:48 left.
Isaiah Cousins had 13 points and 10 rebounds and Jordan Woodard added 10 for Oklahoma, but Iowa State hung late for a crucial win ahead of Monday's matchup at No. 8 Oklahoma State.
The Cowboys should be more focused than ever on the Cyclones after losing to Baylor at home on Saturday.
