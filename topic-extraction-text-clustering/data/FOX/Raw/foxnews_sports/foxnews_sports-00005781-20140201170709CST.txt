GAINESVILLE, Fla. –  Michael Frazier II scored 22 points, Dorian Finney-Smith added 11 and No. 3 Florida overwhelmed Texas A&M 69-36 on Saturday.
The Gators (19-2, 8-0 Southeastern Conference) pushed their winning streak to 13 games and extended a school record for consecutive home wins to 27.
The latest one was another defensive gem. It tied the fewest points Florida has allowed in SEC play since 1950, matching last year's defensive effort against South Carolina.
Florida held the Aggies (12-9, 3-5) to 26 percent shooting and 20 percent from 3-point range. The Gators also outrebounded Texas A&M 57-27.
The Gators closed the first half with a 12-2 run that turned a seven-point lead into a double-digit advantage. They were up 34-17 at the break, and the lead would have been bigger had they hadn't missed 11 of 12 shots from behind the arc..
