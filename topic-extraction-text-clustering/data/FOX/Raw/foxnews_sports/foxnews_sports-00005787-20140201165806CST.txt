DENVER –  Jamie McGinn had two goals and an assist, Gabriel Landeskog also had two goals and the Colorado Avalanche beat the Buffalo Sabres 7-1 on Saturday.
Nathan MacKinnon had a goal and two assists and Semyon Varlamov had 27 saves for the Avalanche, who have won three straight.
Varlamov also had his second assist of the season.
The Avalanche were playing their final home game before going on a four-game East Coast road trip ahead of the Olympic break. They have won eight of 10 and are 35-14-5. It's their best start to a season since 2000-01 when they won the Stanley Cup.
Marc-Andre Cliche scored his first NHL goal and Tyson Barrie also scored for the Avalanche.
Colorado continued its mastery over the Sabres. The Avalanche have won seven straight against Buffalo.
The Avalanche jumped ahead early and didn't need to sweat out the end as they did against Minnesota on Thursday.
They scored three quick goals on Olympian Ryan Miller in the first. Barrie started the flurry with his seventh of the season at 7:37, and McGinn and Landeskog had goals 58 seconds apart later in the period.
Cliche made it 4-0 early in the second.
Miller is headed to his third Olympics for Team USA, but he didn't look sharp against Colorado. He allowed three goals on his first 11 shots and finished with 22 saves. He was pulled in favor of Jhonas Enroth to start the third period.
Enroth had 10 saves
Miller didn't receive much offensive support from his teammates, who had just 10 shots on goal midway through the second. The Sabres finally broke through when Matt D'Agostini scored on the power play at 11:45 of the second.
MacKinnon answered on a power play later in the period to make it 5-1. It was his 20th of the season.
Landeskog and McGinn scored 2:31 apart in the third to make it 7-1.
NOTES: Colorado D Erik Johnson had three assists. ... Avalanche C Paul Stastny (ankle) and RW Alex Tanguay (knee) were scratched. ... Buffalo D Christian Ehrhoff was back in the lineup after missing Thursday's game due to an illness. ... Colorado RW P.A. Parenteau returned to action after being a healthy scratch for two games. He assisted on Landeskog's goal.
