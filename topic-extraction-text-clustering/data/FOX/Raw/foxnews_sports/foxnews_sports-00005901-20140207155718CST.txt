NEW YORK –  Alex Rodriguez has accepted his season-long suspension from Major League Baseball, the longest penalty in the sport's history related to performance-enhancing drugs.
Rodriguez withdrew his lawsuits against Major League Baseball, Commissioner Bud Selig and the players' association to overturn his season-long suspension on Friday. The notices of dismissal were filed in federal court in Manhattan.
Rodriguez was suspended for 211 games last Aug. 5 for violations of baseball's drug agreement and labor contract, and arbitrator Fredric Horowitz cut the penalty on Jan. 11 to 162 games plus the 2014 postseason.
Rodriguez sued two days later.
