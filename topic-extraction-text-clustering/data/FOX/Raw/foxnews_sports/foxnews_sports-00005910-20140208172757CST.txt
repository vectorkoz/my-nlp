LAWRENCE, Kan. –  Andrew Wiggins scored 19 points, Wayne Selden had 17 and No. 8 Kansas survived a foul-fest to beat West Virginia 83-69 on Saturday and pad its lead in the Big 12 standings.
Reserve Tarik Black added 11 points for the Jayhawks (18-5, 9-1 Big 12), who honored the 40th anniversary of their 1974 Final Four team by fending off the Mountaineers (14-10, 6-5) to take a two-game lead over surprising Texas in the conference race.
The 15th-ranked Longhorns on Saturday lost to Kansas State, which will host the Jayhawks on Monday night.
Juwan Staten scored 22 points and Eron Harris had 17 for West Virginia, which dealt with foul trouble nearly the entire game. At one point, the Mountaineers had five players with four fouls apiece, and Brandon Watkins and Devin Williams eventually fouled out.
Still, the Mountaineers hung around until late in the game.
