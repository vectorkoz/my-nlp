CHARLOTTE, N.C. –  Spurs coach Gregg Popovich says forward/center Tim Duncan and guard Tony Parker will return to action against the Charlotte Bobcats.
However, Popovich says center Tiago Splitter (right calf contusion) and guard Marco Belinelli (back spasms) will be inactive for Saturday night's game along with Kawhi Leonard and Manu Ginobili.
Popovich gave Duncan the night off Thursday against the Brooklyn Nets, while Parker was held out with back spasms. The Spurs (36-14) lost the game 103-89, their fourth defeat in the last seven games.
