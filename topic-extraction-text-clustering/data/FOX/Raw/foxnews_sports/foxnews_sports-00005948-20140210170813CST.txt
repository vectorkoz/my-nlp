COLUMBUS, Ohio –  The temperature outside Ohio State's Schottenstein Center was in the teens and the wind chill near zero. And the students kept coming over on Monday.
They set up tents on the cold concrete, waiting for prime seats for Tuesday night's game against rival Michigan.
Fans at the encampment, dubbed Mattaritaville after coach Thad Matta, know this is a big game.
Ohio State (19-5, 6-5 Big Ten) has won three in a row to climb back to No. 22 in this week's Associated Press poll after plummeting out of the rankings in the wake of a 1-5 spell in January.
Michigan (17-6, 9-2) is tied with Michigan State atop the Big Ten heading into its final seven conference games.
