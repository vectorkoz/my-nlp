DALLAS –  Larry Brown knows his quick turnaround at SMU is much different than anything the Hall of Fame coach has done in the past.
Less than two years after Brown returned to college, the No. 23 Mustangs (19-5) are in The Associated Press rankings for the first time since March 1985. They are undefeated at home, with three wins over ranked teams in only five weeks.
The 73-year-old Brown has had a record nine NBA head jobs. His previous college head coaching jobs were at long-established programs Kansas and UCLA.
SMU hasn't been to an NCAA tournament since 1993, but Brown arrived hopeful of having a terrific program playing at a high level.
Only 56 games into Brown's tenure, the Mustangs certainly seem to be on a fast track.
