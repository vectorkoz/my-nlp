CHAPEL HILL, N.C. –  Wednesday night's rivalry game between No. 8 Duke and North Carolina has been postponed due to a storm that brought enough snow and ice to paralyze many area roads.
A makeup date hasn't been set yet. The decision came about 3½ hours before the teams were scheduled to tip at 9:10 p.m.
UNC athletic director Bubba Cunningham said in a statement that Duke's bus wasn't able to make it to the Durham campus to pick up the Blue Devils for the 11-mile drive to Chapel Hill. He called the postponement "the best decision to make at this time" due to safety concerns.
Atlantic Coast Conference policy states that games will go in during bad weather if teams, officials and operations staffers can make it to the venue.
