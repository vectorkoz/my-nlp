LAWRENCE, Kan. –  Perry Ellis scored a career-high 32 points, Andrew Wiggins added 17 and No. 7 Kansas overcame a sluggish start and a virtuoso performance by TCU's Kyan Anderson in a 95-65 victory Saturday.
Ellis also had eight rebounds and five assists, and Wayne Selden Jr. scored 15 points for the Jayhawks (19-6, 10-2 Big 12), who actually trailed by as many as six in the first half.
Playing without injured center Joel Embiid and suspended forward Brannen Greene, Kansas still managed to build a 47-40 lead by the break. The Jayhawks then used a 13-1 charge out of the locker room to put away the Horned Frogs (9-15, 0-12) for the sixth time in seven meetings.
TCU still has not won since knocking off Texas Southern on Dec. 29.
