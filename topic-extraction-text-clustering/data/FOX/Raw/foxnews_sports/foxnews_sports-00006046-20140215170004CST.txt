LOS ANGELES –  William McGirt made eight birdies in 13 holes and wound up with a 6-under 65 on Saturday in the Northern Trust Open for a two-shot lead going into the final round.
McGirt has never held a 54-hole lead on the PGA Tour. He had one close call when he was runner-up at the Canadian Open two years ago. With steady play in calm conditions off Sunset Boulevard, he opened up a two-shot lead over George McNeill (66) and Charlie Beljan (68).
The leaderboard was about a crowded as the 405, even without half the lanes closed.
Jason Allred, who hasn't played a PGA Tour event in more than three years and qualified for this event Monday, was three shots behind. Jimmy Walker and Jordan Spieth were among those four back.
