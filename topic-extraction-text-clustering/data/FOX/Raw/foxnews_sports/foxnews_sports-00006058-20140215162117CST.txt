STATE COLLEGE, Pa. –  Melsahn Basabe scored 16 points and No. 16 Iowa pulled away from Penn State 82-70 on Saturday.

Penn State (13-13, 4-9) was led by D.J. Newbill, who scored 22 points, but Tim Frazier was held to 11.
The game was tied four times in the second half before Iowa stretched it out with a 14-4 run.
