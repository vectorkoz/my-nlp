TAMPA, Fla. –  Bria Hartley scored 18 points and Breanna Stewart and Stefanie Dolson each had 15 to help No. 1 Connecticut remain unbeaten with a 63-38 rout of cold-shooting South Florida on Sunday.
The Huskies (26-0, 13-0 American Athletic Conference) also got 12 points, eight rebounds and eight assists from 5-foot-7 guard Moriah Jefferson while holding USF (13-11, 8-5) to 26 percent shooting.
Inga Orekhova made four 3-pointers and led USF with 13 points, but the Bulls leading scorer Courtney Williams was limited to seven points — matching a season low — on 3 of 18 shooting.
UConn won an earlier matchup between the teams by 28 three weeks ago, and the defending national champions had little difficulty extending their winning streak to 32 consecutive games despite playing without All-American forward Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, who is expected to be sidelined three to six weeks because of mononucleosis.
