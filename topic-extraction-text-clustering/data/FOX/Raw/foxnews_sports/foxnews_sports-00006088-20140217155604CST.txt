Even Gov. Dave Heineman is getting caught up in the hype surrounding Nebraska's major college basketball teams.
The Creighton Bluejays (21-4, 11-2) lead the Big East and their star Doug McDermott is a top candidate for national player of the year.
The Nebraska Cornhuskers (14-10, 6-6) upset then-No. 9 Michigan State on the road Sunday.
Their fifth win in six games pushed them to .500 in the Big Ten, and they're bidding to make the NCAA field for the first time since 1998.
Heineman has been following college basketball since he was a cadet at West Point and Bobby Knight was Army's coach. He told The Associated Press on Monday he's relishing the possibility of Creighton and Nebraska making the NCAA tournament in the same year.
