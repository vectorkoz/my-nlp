MARANA, Ariz. –  Graeme McDowell pulled off the biggest stunner on a day of comebacks in the Match Play Championship.
McDowell won the last three holes against Gary Woodland to force extra holes, and then beat him with a 6-foot birdie on the 19th hole on Wednesday. It was a classic case of this fickle event providing hope even when it appears to be hopeless.
Jason Dufner also escaped against Scott Stallings. The PGA champion rallied from 3 down with five holes to play to beat Stallings with a par in 19 holes.
Henrik Stenson was in a battle with Kiradech Aphibarnrat of Thailand. They were all square with four holes to play. Stenson was trying to avoid being the third straight No. 1 seed to lose in the opening round.
