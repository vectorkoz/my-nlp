DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. –  Chevrolet believes a pinched wire caused a pace car fire during last week's Sprint Unlimited exhibition race at Daytona International Speedway.
Jeff Chow, marketing manager for Chevrolet Racing, says preliminary reports indicate the pinched wire started the fire in the trunk of the Chevrolet SS pace car. Chow says "it appears we had a pinched wire in one of the strobe systems."
Chow was on hand Thursday as the auto manufacturer unveiled three new pace cars to be used this weekend at Daytona: a Silverado 1500 for the Truck Series opener Friday, a Camaro SS for the Nationwide opener Saturday and a Chevrolet SS for the Daytona 500 on Sunday. All three have LED lighting systems that don't use the same kind of wires that seemingly caused the fire.
