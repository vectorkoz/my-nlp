MARANA, Ariz. –  Not even Graeme McDowell can believe he's still alive in the Match Play Championship.
For the third straight round, McDowell pulled off another improbable escape to advance to the quarterfinals Friday at Dove Mountain. This time, all he had to do was win the last two holes against Hunter Mahan to force overtime and make a 20-foot par putt to stay in the match on the 20th hole. He won with a birdie on the 21st hole.
In three matches, McDowell has played 58 holes and has never had the lead until he won.
Jordan Spieth beat Matt Kuchar. Ernie Els ousted Jason Dufner, Victor Dubuisson beat Bubba Watson, and Rickie Fowler won on the last hole against Sergio Garcia. The other winners were Louis Oosthuizen and Jason Day.
