LEXINGTON, Ky. –  Julius Randle scored in the lane with 3.9 seconds remaining in overtime gave No. 15 Kentucky a hard-earned 77-76 victory over LSU on Saturday.
After Andre Stringer's jumper with 12 seconds left gave LSU a 76-75 lead, James Young's shot on the other end was blocked. Randle was able to grab the loose ball and hit the game-winning short jumper, sparking a delirious celebration with his Wildcats teammates piling on top of him on LSU's end of the court.
Randle's shot provided a fitting end to a tight, tense game symbolized by the back-and-forth overtime period before Kentucky (21-6, 11-3 Southeastern Conference) made good use of its last possession for an emotional win that earned a season split with LSU (16-10, 7-7).
Randle finished with eight points and 15 rebounds for Kentucky, which got 21 points from Aaron Harrison and 20 from James Young.
Johnny O'Bryant III and Anthony Hickey both had 20 points for LSU.
