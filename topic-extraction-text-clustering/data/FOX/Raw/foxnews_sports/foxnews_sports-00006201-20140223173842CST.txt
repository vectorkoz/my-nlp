LINCOLN, Neb. –  Terran Petteway scored 29 points to lead surging Nebraska, which won its fifth straight game, over Purdue 76-57 Sunday.
Nebraska (16-10, 8-6 Big Ten) used a 26-8 second half run to take down the Boilermakers (15-12, 5-9).
The Huskers have won five straight conference games for the first times since 1998-99 and have won eight conference games for the first time since 2008-09 when it was a member of the Big 12.
Nebraska took control of the game late in a low-scoring first half. With Purdue center A.J. Hammons on the bench, Nebraska went on a 7-0 run capped by a Petteway fast break layup to take a 21-14 lead and stretched that advantage to 30-20 on Shavon Shields' three-point play with 1:04 left in the first half.
Shields finished with 18 points and 10 rebounds for Nebraska and Walter Pitchford had 10.
Terone Johnson led Purdue with nine points.
