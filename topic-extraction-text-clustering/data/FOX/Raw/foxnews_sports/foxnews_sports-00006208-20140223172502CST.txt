DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. –  Jimmie Johnson's phone is blowing up — and he's nowhere near Victory Lane.
Johnson is being hailed as the Daytona 500 champion all over the place — he's trending on Twitter and even has friends congratulating him via text message — despite the race being in a rain delay Sunday.
Fox Sports showed a replay of last year's season opener, the one in which Johnson won his second 500 and Danica Patrick made history by becoming the first woman to lead laps in "The Great American Race."
Fox ran a crawl across the bottom of the screen, saying the 2013 race is being shown while Sunday's race is being delayed because of rain. But thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands, of people failed to get the message.
Drivers and NASCAR had fun with the errors.
