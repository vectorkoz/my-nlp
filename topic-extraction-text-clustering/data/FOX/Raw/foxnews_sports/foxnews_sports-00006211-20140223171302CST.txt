MIAMI –  With LeBron James watching from the bench in a suit and tie, Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade powered the Miami Heat to a 93-79 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Sunday.
James was a late scratch after he broke his nose in Thursday's win at Oklahoma City, and his teammates picked up the slack, with reserves Chris Andersen, Michael Beasley and Ray Allen helping the Heat pull away in the second half.
Bosh tied a career high with four 3-pointers and had 28 points and 10 rebounds. Wade added 23 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists, while Mario Chalmers contributed 12 points and nine assists.
