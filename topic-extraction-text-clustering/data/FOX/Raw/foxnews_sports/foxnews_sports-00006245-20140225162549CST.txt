PEORIA, Ariz. –  Joe Torre says Major League Baseball's playing rules committee leaned toward banning all home plate collisions but concluded it would be unrealistic because contact between catchers and baserunners is sometimes unavoidable.
Torre, MLB's executive vice president for baseball operations, spoke Tuesday at San Diego's spring training facility before meeting with representatives from eight clubs training in Arizona. Torre was there to answer questions and address concerns regarding the new collision rule, which was announced Monday, and expanded instant replay for umpirest replay.
Torre said when it came to the rule on home plate collisions he had to "put the uniform back on" because there is never a perfect play at the plate and throws can make contact unavoidable.
MLB could not have implemented the rule this year without approval from the players' association.
