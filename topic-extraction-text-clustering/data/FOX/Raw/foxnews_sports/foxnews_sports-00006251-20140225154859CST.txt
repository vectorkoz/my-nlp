SAN FRANCISCO –  Vernon Davis is back in the Bay Area following a whirlwind, three-night visit to the Sochi Olympics as USA Curling's honorary captain, and the 49ers tight end is now ready to resume his regular offseason training regimen.
That will likely begin next week, as Davis is still recuperating from the travel while spending some quality time with his family. He says it "was well worth it" given the Olympians he met and the opportunity to support a sport that gets a boost from an NFL superstar.
