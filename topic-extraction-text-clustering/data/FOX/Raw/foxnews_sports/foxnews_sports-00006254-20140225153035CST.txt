TAMPA, Fla. –  Heisman Trophy winner Jameis Winston grounded out to second and struck out looking in Florida State's 8-3 loss to the New York Yankees on Tuesday.
Winston entered in left field in the fifth inning and hit a groundball on an 0-2 pitch from Shane Greene during the sixth. In the eighth, Winston took a full-count pitch from Bryan Mitchell for a called third strike.
Winston led the Seminoles football team to the national championship in a 34-31 victory over Auburn on January 6.
Brett Gardner had an infield single in his lone at-bat and Brendan Ryan hit an RBI double for the Yankees, who played their spring training opener.
Most of the Yankees regular did not play. Joining Gardner and Ryan in the lineup were Kelly Johnson and Francisco Cervelli.
