PORTLAND, Ore. –  Jason Collins had better get used to the spotlight.
At least for the next week or so, Collins will likely be the face of the Brooklyn Nets wherever they go.
The NBA's first openly gay player was surrounded by dozens of cameras and microphones at the shootaround in Portland before Wednesday night's game. Teammate Deron Williams even snapped photos of the crowd.
The 7-foot Collins was signed Sunday to a 10-day contract. He played in a 108-102 victory over the Lakers that night, with two rebounds and a steal in just under 11 minutes.
The Nets next visit Denver. The family of slain Wyoming college student Matthew Shepard is expected to attend the game Thursday night. Collins wears No. 98 in tribute to Shepard.
