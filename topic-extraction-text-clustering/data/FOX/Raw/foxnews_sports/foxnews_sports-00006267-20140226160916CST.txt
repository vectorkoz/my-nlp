COLUMBUS, Ohio –  It's one of the most memorable — or is it forgettable? — home losses for Ohio State in recent years.
When Penn State pulled off a 71-70 shocker in overtime Jan. 29, it ended a string of 80 consecutive victories by the Buckeyes on their home court against unranked opponents. For the Nittany Lions to do it — they came in 0-17 against Ohio State coach Thad Matta — added to the Buckeyes' misery.
When the teams meet again Thursday night in Happy Valley, the No. 22 Buckeyes (22-6, 9-6 Big Ten) say they're a different team. Having won six of seven, including their last three, they have a lot riding on the outcome.
So do the Nittany Lions (13-14, 4-10) in their final home game.
