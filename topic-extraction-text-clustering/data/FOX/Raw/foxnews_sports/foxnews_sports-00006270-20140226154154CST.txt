CLEARWATER, Fla. –  Jose Bautista hit a long home run off Roberto Hernandez three batters into the game, and the Toronto Blue Jays beat the Philadelphia Phillies 4-3 Wednesday in rain-shortened spring training opener for both teams.
Bautista's home run landed outside of the ballpark at Bright House Field. The game was called in the middle of the seventh inning.
Bautista missed the last six weeks of the season with a hip injury, the second straight year in which he ended the season on the disabled list. He was 1 for 2 with a walk and two runs scored Wednesday.
Ryan Howard and Marlon Byrd each had run-scoring singles off former Phillies left-hander J.A. Happ in the bottom of the first.
