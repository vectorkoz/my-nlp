BRADENTON, Fla. –  Jacoby Ellsbury reached base in all three plate appearances of his New York Yankees' spring training debut, scoring twice Wednesday in 6-5 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates.
Ellsbury, who left World Series champion Boston for a $153 million, seven-year contract with New York, walked twice and had an infield single in the exhibition opener. He was on base in the second inning when Yangervis Solarte hit a two-run homer off Edinson Volquez.
Pittsburgh trailed 4-0 but scored twice in the second and four times in the seventh, when Tony Sanchez hit a tying three-run homer against Chase Whitley. Chris McGuiness had a go-ahead single that drove in former-Yankee Chris Dickerson.
Yankees starter Ivan Nova allowed two runs, two hits and two walks in 1 1-3 innings. Pirates starter Francisco Liriano gave two runs, three hits and a walk in one inning.
