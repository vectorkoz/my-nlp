PHOENIX –  Ryan Braun hit a two-run homer in his first at-bat back from suspension, Juan Francisco slugged two homers and the Milwaukee Brewers opened their spring training schedule with an 11-3 win Thursday over the Oakland Athletics.
Braun hit an 0-1 pitch from starter Tommy Milone high in the air and over the fence near the left-field corner. The 2011 NL MVP was greeted by mainly a hearty chorus of cheers, though there were some jeers before the at-bat.
It was Braun's first time in the Brewers lineup since July 21, 2013. He was suspended the next day for violating Major League Baseball's anti-drug agreement.
Milone was tagged for three runs in two innings, while Jed Lowrie had a two-run double in the first for Oakland.
