PEORIA, Ariz. –  Robinson Cano lined a single into center field on the first pitch he saw in a Seattle uniform, part of a two-run first inning that sent the Mariners over the San Diego Padres 7-1 on Thursday in a Cactus League opener.
Cano drew the loudest ovation of the day when he was introduced, then got his hit against Eric Stults. The All-Star left the Yankees in the offseason and signed a $240 million, 10-year contract with the Mariners.
Cano played three innings. He walked on four pitches in the third before being lifted for a pinch runner. He had two assists playing at second base.
Seattle starter Erasmo Ramirez gave up two hits and struck out one in two innings.
