TEMPE, Ariz. –  Mike Trout wasted little time in showing off his million-dollar swing.
The young star hit a grand slam onto the berm by the left-field foul pole and drove in five runs Friday in the Los Angeles Angels' 15-3 win over the Chicago Cubs.
Trout struck out in the first and hit an RBI single that capped a four-run second against Cubs starter Chris Rusin. He hit the grand slam against James McDonald in a nine-run fourth.
Trout agreed Wednesday to a $1 million deal, a record for a one-year major league contract for a player not yet eligible for arbitration who wasn't coming to the big leagues from Japan or Cuba or wasn't required to have a larger amount because of the maximum-cut rule.
Jered Weaver allowed one hit in three innings, Darwin Barney's infield single in the first, against a Cubs team that featured mostly backups and players bound for the minors.
Chris Iannetta homered and drove in three runs for the Angels. Barney homered against Brian Moran in the fourth, and prospect Kris Bryant hit a two-run drive off Jarrett Grube in the seventh.
J. B. Shuck played left in place of injured Josh Hamilton and went 2 for 3 with a triple with three RBIs. Hamilton strained a left calf muscle Tuesday and is expected to be sidelined for at least two weeks.
