SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. –  Franklin Morales pitched two shutout innings in his bid to return to the Colorado staff and the Rockies beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 11-0 Friday.
The 28-year-old Morales both started and relieved for the Rockies from 2007-11. He was traded to Boston during his final season in Colorado.
The left-hander gave up a double to Matt Tuiasosopo, walked two and struck out one. He threw 36 pitches, including 21 strikes.
Patrick Corbin, projected as the D-Backs' No. 1 starter, pitched four innings, giving up two runs and four hits.
Corbin blanked the Rockies for two innings but then gave up a two-run homer to pinch-hitter Ryan Casteel in the third.
