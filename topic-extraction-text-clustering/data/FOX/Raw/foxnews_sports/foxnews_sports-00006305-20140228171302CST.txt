PEORIA, Ariz. –  James Paxton retired all six batters, Nick Franklin homered and the Seattle Mariners beat the San Diego Padres 12-1 on Friday.
With starter Taijuan Walker shut down for at least a week with shoulder inflammation and Hisashi Iwakuma yet to throw this spring because of a finger problem, the Mariners are leaning on Paxton to claim a rotation spot.
The left-hander struck out Nick Hundley on a high fastball. Third baseman Willie Bloomquist's two fine defensive plays helped Paxton in a 19-pitch outing.
Franklin homered off Tim Stauffer in the third. Nate Tenbrink and James Jones also homered.
Andrew Cashner threw two scoreless innings, new setup man Joaquin Benoit gave up one hit in a scoreless inning and Ryan Jackson doubled and scored for the Padres.
Seattle star Robinson Cano was given the afternoon off.
