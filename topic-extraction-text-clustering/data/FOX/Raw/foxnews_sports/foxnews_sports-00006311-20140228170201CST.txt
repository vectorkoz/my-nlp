PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. –  Rory McIlroy bounced back from a rough start for a 4-under 66 that gave him a one-shot lead in the Honda Classic.
Tiger Woods had to scramble Friday to narrowly make the cut.
McIlroy made six birdies in a 10-hole stretch and looked good from tee-to-green at PGA National to take the lead into the weekend of a PGA Tour event for the first time in 18 months.
McIlroy was at 11-under 129.
Brendon de Jonge was tied for the lead until making bogey on his final hole for a 64. He was one behind.
Woods hit only two greens in regulation on the back nine of PGA National. His only birdie was on the 13th when he chipped in. He shot 69 to make the cut on the number.
