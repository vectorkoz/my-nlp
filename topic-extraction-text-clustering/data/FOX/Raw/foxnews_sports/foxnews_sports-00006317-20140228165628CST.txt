GLENDALE, Ariz. –  Hyun-Jin Ryu allowed two hits over two innings in his first spring training start, and the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Chicago White Sox 5-0 Friday.
Ryu, 14-8 with a 3.00 ERA as a rookie last year, didn't have a walk or a strikeout,
White Sox starter Chris Sale also made his exhibition season debut, striking out four in 2 2-3 scoreless innings, allowing one hit and walking none.
Held to two hits over the first six innings by five pitchers, Los Angeles went ahead in the seventh when outfield prospect Joc Pederson hit a two-run homer off Jake Petricka. Pederson was the Dodgers' minor league player of the year in 2012 and was picked for last year's All-Star Futures game.
