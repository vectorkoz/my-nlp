FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. –  Coty Clarke scored a career-high 23 points as Arkansas continued its recent surge with an 87-75 win over Georgia on Saturday.
The win is the second in two days for the Razorbacks (20-9, 9-7 Southeastern Conference) over one of the SEC's top teams, following their win at Kentucky on Thursday night.
Clarke had 15 points in the first half, and he was joined in double figures by Michael Qualls with 20.
Arkansas has now won five straight SEC games for the first time since 2010, giving it 20 wins for the first time since the 2007-08 season — the last time it went to the NCAA tournament.
Kenny Gaines led the Bulldogs (16-12, 10-6) with 25 points, while Marcus Thornton had 13 and Brandon Morris 11.
