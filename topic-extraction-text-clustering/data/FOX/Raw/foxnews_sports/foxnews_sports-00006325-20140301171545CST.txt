NASHVILLE, Tenn. –  Olli Jokinen, Andrew Ladd and Devin Setoguchi scored and Ondrej Pavelec stopped 39 shots and the Winnipeg Jets beat the Nashville Predators 3-1 Saturday.
The Jets, ranked sixth in the NHL in penalty kills coming into the game, didn't allow a goal on six Nashville power plays.
One of the Predators' strengths has been converting man-advantage chances. Entering the game, they were fifth in the league, but Pavelec stopped Nashville on each power play.
Simon Moser scored his first goal of the season for Nashville.
