STORRS, Conn. –  Breanna Stewart and Bria Hartley each scored 20 points to help No. 1 UConn remain unbeaten with a 72-35 victory over No. 24 Rutgers on Saturday.
The victory gave the Huskies (30-0, 17-0 American) at least a share of the inaugural American Athletic Conference regular season title. The Huskies will play No. 3 Louisville on Monday with a chance to win the conference championship outright. If Louisville wins, a coin flip would determine the top seed for the conference tournament.
UConn won the Big East regular season title 20 times before its move to the American this past year.
Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, who missed the previous four games with mononucleosis, returned and scored seven points in 27 minutes.
Stewart, who had 10 rebounds, scored 11 of her 13 first-half points in the first 6:27 as Connecticut opened an 18-8 lead. Hartley, one of two Connecticut seniors honored on senior day, made consecutive 3-pointers that eventually have UConn a 26-8 lead.
UConn held Rutgers scoreless for a period of 5 minutes, 20 seconds in the first half and gradually extended its lead. Rutgers (21-7, 12-5) missed six shots in that span.
Hartley's third three of the first half gave UConn its biggest lead at 40-16. The Huskies led 45-20 at halftime.
Connecticut outscored Rutgers 10-4 to begin the second half and opened a 55-24 lead. Rutgers never threatened.
Moriah Jefferson had nine points, five rebounds and four assists and Stefanie Dolson had six points and 10 rebounds. Kiah Stokes added 11 rebounds.
Dolson became the fifth player in UConn program history to amass 1,000 points and 1,000 rebounds, joining Tina Charles, Rebecca Lobo, Maya Moore and Jamelle Elliott.
Betnijah Laney led Rutgers with 14 points.
Connecticut also set a team record for blocks in a single season. Stokes' block in the first half gave UConn its 251st block and the record.
Kahleah Copper, Rutgers' leading scorer, missed the only shot she attempted early and missed the rest of the game with turf toe.
