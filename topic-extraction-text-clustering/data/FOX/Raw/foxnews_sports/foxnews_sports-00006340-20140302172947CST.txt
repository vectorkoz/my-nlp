BLOOMINGTON, Ind. –  Kevin "Yogi" Ferrell scored 20 points and Will Sheehey added 19 on Sunday, leading Indiana past No. 22 Ohio State 72-64.
It was the second straight win for the Hoosiers (17-12, 7-9 Big Ten) — both over ranked teams in the last four days.
LaQuinton Ross and Lenzelle Smith Jr. had 19 points each for the Buckeyes (22-8, 9-8) who lost their second straight — both road games against teams in the bottom half of the conference race.
And this one came on a day the Hoosiers were without freshman Noah Vonleh, the conference's leading rebounder, because of an injured foot.
But after falling into an early 19-12 deficit, the Hoosiers took control.
They closed the half on a 21-5 run to take a 33-25 lead, fended off two second-half charges from Ohio State and sealed it from the free throw line in the final minute.
