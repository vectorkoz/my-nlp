UNIONDALE, N.Y. –  Scottie Upshall scored twice in the third period as part of a four-goal Panthers surge and Florida downed the New York Islanders 5-3 on Sunday.
Upshall's 11th of the season broke a 3-3 tie at 10:31 of the final period. The goal came on the rebound of shot by Shawn Mattias, who also scored two goals for the Panthers.
Upshall tapped the loose puck past backup goaltender Anders Nilsson, who started in place of Evgeni Nabokov. Upshall scored again at 15:26 on the power play to make it 5-3 for Florida. Tim Thomas made 35 saves for the Panthers.
The Islanders entered the third with a 3-1 advantage after Thomas Vanek scored twice in the first and Ryan Strome added a goal late in the second.
But Florida's Marcel Goc and Matthias scored early in the third to tie the game at 3 before Upshall's late scores.
