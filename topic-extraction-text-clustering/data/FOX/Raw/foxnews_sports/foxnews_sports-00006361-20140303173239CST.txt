SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. –  The first spring training test of baseball's expanded instant replay system has gotten off to a smooth start.
Three calls were challenged Monday, and the umpire's ruling was upheld each time.
Extra replay was in place for three games. Two calls were checked in the game between Toronto and Minnesota, there was one review in the Angels-Diamondbacks game and none when the Chicago Cubs played Milwaukee.
Each team in the majors will have at least five exhibition games with the new system in place.
In January, owners approved the use of additional video replay to review most calls other than balls-and-strikes. Previously, umpires could only go to replay to review home runs and boundary calls.
