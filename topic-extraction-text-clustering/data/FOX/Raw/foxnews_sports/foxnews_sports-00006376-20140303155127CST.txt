BRADENTON, Fla. –  Pedro Alvarez and Russell Martin hit two-run homers off Brandon Workman, who started in place of injured Jake Peavy, and the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the Boston Red Sox 7-6 Monday.
Pittsburgh leadoff batter Starling Marte reached on an infield single in the first that stopped an 0-for-9 start, and Alvarez homered to right off Brandon Workman with two outs. Marte singled in the third and Martin followed with a drive to left, his second homer in two days.
Workman gave up five runs and five hits in 2 1-3 innings in place of Peavy, the right-hander who accidentally cut his left index finger with a fishing knife last weekend.
Pirates starter Francisco Liriano strick out three and walked one in two hitless innings.
Mike Carp, trying to win a bench job with the Red Sox, hit a two-run homer against Bryan Morris in the eighth.
