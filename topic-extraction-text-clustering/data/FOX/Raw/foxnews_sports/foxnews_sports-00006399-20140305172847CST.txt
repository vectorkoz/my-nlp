SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. –  Kansas City ace James Shields allowed one hit in three scoreless innings and Mike Moustakas hit a three-run homer in the Royals' 6-5 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Wednesday.
A.J. Pollock's leadoff single in the third was the only hit Shields has allowed in four innings this spring. Shields struck out three with no walks.
Patrick Corbin, set to be Arizona's opening-day starter against the Los Angeles Dodgers in Sydney, Australia, on March 22, gave up two runs on four hits in four innings. He struck out four and walked two.
Moustakas' deep shot to right off lefty Joe Paterson was his third homer of the spring. He had four RBIs in the game, giving him 10, most of any player in spring training.
