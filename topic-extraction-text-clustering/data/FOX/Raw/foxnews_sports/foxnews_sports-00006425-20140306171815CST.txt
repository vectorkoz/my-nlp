DORAL, Fla. –  Tiger Woods only made it through 10 holes Thursday — this time because of the weather, not his back.
The opening round of the Cadillac Championship was stopped for more than two hours because of menacing thunderstorms.
Woods failed to make a birdie in the 10 holes he played. When the round was suspended by darkness, he hit a wedge some 20 yards short of his target and three-putted from 55 feet on the par-5 10th hole. He was at 2-over par.
Harris English finished with a 3-under 69 for a share of the lead with Jason Dufner, Hunter Mahan, Francesco Molinari and Patrick Reed, who all had to return Friday morning to complete the first round.
Woods walked off after 13 holes Sunday in the Honda Classic because of lower back pain and spasms.
