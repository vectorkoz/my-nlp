SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. –  Tim Hudson extended his spring training scoreless streak to five innings, Pablo Sandoval homered to lead off a three-run fifth and the San Francisco Giants defeated the Cincinnati Reds 3-2 Thursday.
Hudson gave up two hits in three innings, struck out three and walked two. He also started a double play on Ramon Santiago's first-inning comebacker after Roger Bernadina's leadoff walk.
Hudson had pitched a pair of shutout innings against Arizona on March 2, his first game action since breaking an ankle July 24 when the New York Mets' Eric Young Jr. inadvertently stepped on the back of the pitcher's lower right leg at first base.
Left-hander Tony Cingrani pitched three hitless innings for the Reds.
Chien-Ming Wang gave up Sandoval's homer and run-scoring hits by Juan Perez and Angel Pagan.
