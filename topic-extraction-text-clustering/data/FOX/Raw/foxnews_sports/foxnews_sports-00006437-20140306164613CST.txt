CLEARWATER, Fla. –  Derek Jeter had two hits that ended an 0-for-10 slide at the start of spring training and Masahiro Tanaka gave up a home run to Freddy Galvis in the New York Yankees' 4-3 win over the Philadelphia Phillies on Thursday.
Jeter, limited to 17 games last season after breaking an ankle during the 2012 playoffs, grounded out in the first inning, then singled to left in the third and doubled to center in the fifth.
Tanaka, the Japanese star signed to a $155 million, seven-year contract, made his second spring-training appearance and second against the Phillies. Starting for the first time, he allowed two hits and one run in three innings, giving up Galvis' tying homer in the third.
"I felt that I wasn't at the top of my game going onto the mound today," Tanaka said through a translator. "Including the results and everything, I feel like I did OK."
Phillies starter Kyle Kendrick gave up one run and three hits in three-innings, including a home run by Ramon Flores leading off the third.
