RIO GRANDE, Puerto Rico –  James Driscoll matched the Puerto Rico Open record with a 9-under 63 on Friday to take a one-stroke lead after the second round.
Playing in wind gusting to 20 mph at Trump International, Driscoll had an eagle and seven birdies in his bogey-free round. He had a 12-under 132 total.
Driscoll also shot a 63 in the 2011 tournament for a share of the record set by Derek Lamely in 2010 and also matched by Chris Tidland in 2011 and Scott Brown last year.
Chesson Hadley was second after a 65.
Eric Axley was 10 under after a 66, and Jonathan Byrd, Wes Roach, Ben Martin and Danny Lee were another stroke back. Byrd and Roach shot 66, Martin 67, and Lee 68.
