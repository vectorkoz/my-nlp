SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. –  Brett Anderson pitched three positive innings in his first start against his former team on Saturday, helping the Colorado Rockies to a 5-4 victory over the Oakland Athletics.
The left-hander allowed one run on three hits and struck out one.
Anderson was Oakland's opening-day starter a year ago. But he spent four months on the disabled list, was demoted to the bullpen and then traded in December.
Troy Tulowitzki had an RBI double in a three-run first against A's starter A.J. Griffin.
Oakland manager Bob Melvin was ejected in the seventh for arguing a strike call. He was gone by the time Shane Peterson lost Ben Paulsen's fly ball with two outs in the ninth. It fell in front of him, and Cristhian Adames scored from first to win it.
