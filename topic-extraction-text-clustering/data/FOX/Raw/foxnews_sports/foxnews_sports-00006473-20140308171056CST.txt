DORAL, Fla. –  Patrick Reed had a 3-under 69 in tamer conditions Saturday at Doral to take a two-shot lead into a final round that will prominently feature Tiger Woods for the first time this year.
Reed played a four-shot stretch around the turn in 4-under par to surge into the lead. He did enough right on the closing holes to keep his distance over PGA champion Jason Dufner (68) and Hunter Mahan (71).
Woods delivered the low round of the tournament. He made eight birdies for a 66, calling it the most complete round he has played this year. He wound up only three shots out of the lead as he goes for his fifth career win on the Blue Monster.
Jamie Donaldson of Wales had a 71 and was tied with Woods.
