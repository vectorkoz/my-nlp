DULUTH, Ga. –  Meighan Simmons scored 17 points, including two go-ahead free throws with 1:45 remaining, and No. 6 Tennessee edged 12th-ranked Kentucky 71-70 on Sunday to win another SEC tournament championship.
Simmons, who struggled with her shooting from the field throughout the tournament, made the two free throws to snap a 63-63 tie. The free throws gave the Lady Vols (27-5) only their second lead of the second half, and they didn't trail again as Simmons added a layup and two more free throws in the final 22 seconds.
Isabelle Harrison had 16 points as Tennessee claimed its record 17th Southeastern Conference tournament title, including four in the last five years.
Kentucky (24-8) played in its fourth final in the last five years but still hasn't won the tournament since 1982. DeNesha Stallworth led the Wildcats with 21 points.
