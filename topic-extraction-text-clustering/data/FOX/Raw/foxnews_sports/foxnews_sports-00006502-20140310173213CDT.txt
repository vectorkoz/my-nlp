ALBANY, N.Y. –  Shereesha Richards had 26 points, Sarah Royals added 19 points and eight assists, and top-seeded Albany beat second-seeded Stony Brook 70-46 on Monday to win the America East title and earn the conference's automatic bid into the NCAA tournament.
It was the third straight America East tournament title for Albany (28-4), only the fourth team to accomplish the three-peat. Maine holds the record with four, ending in 1998.
Albany leads the all-time series with Stony Brook 28-22, including nine of the last 10, but the Seawolves (24-8) took the previous game, a 66-56 win at SEFCU Arena on March 1 that snapped Albany's conference-record 38-game winning streak over two seasons.
Stony Brook has never won the America East Conference title.
