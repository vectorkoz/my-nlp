LAS VEGAS –  Keani Albanez scored 20 points and No. 18 Gonzaga dominated BYU defensively to win the West Coast Conference tournament for the sixth time in seven years, beating the Cougars 71-57 on Tuesday.
After some early struggles against WCC player of the year Jennifer Hamson, Gonzaga (29-4) turned the title game into a rout, holding the Cougars (26-6) to 30 percent shooting while forcing 21 turnovers.
Hamson scored eight quick points, but the Bulldogs limited her chances during a key stretch to build a 16-point halftime lead. She finished with 24 points on 10-of-18 shooting.
Gonzaga also made life difficult for Lexi Eaton, BYU's second-leading scorer. She got 11 of her 15 points from the free-throw line after shooting 2 of 18.
Sunny Greinacher had 16 points and Lindsay Sherbert scored 15 for Gonzaga in its seventh straight WCC title-game appearance.
