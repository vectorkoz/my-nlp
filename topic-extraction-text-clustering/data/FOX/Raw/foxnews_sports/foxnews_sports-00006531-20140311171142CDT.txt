GREENSBORO, N.C. –  This week's Atlantic Coast Conference tournament has a new look, from more teams and an extra round of games to the school holding the No. 1 seed.
Sixth-ranked Virginia is hoping to pair its first outright regular-season title in 33 years with its first ACC tournament title since winning its only other one in 1976.
The Cavaliers (25-6, 16-2) finished two games ahead of No. 11 Syracuse, but they haven't reached the semifinals since 1995. Virginia guard Joe Harris said his Cavs need to take a step forward by playing well in Greensboro.
The tournament starts Wednesday with the lowest-seeded teams, while the Cavaliers and the rest of the top four seeds — the Orange, No. 7 Duke and No. 15 North Carolina — don't play until Friday's quarterfinals.
