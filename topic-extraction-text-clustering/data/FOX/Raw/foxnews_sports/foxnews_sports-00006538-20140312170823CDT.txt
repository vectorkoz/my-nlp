KANSAS CITY, Mo. –  Injured Kansas center Joel Embiid remains unlikely to return before the second weekend of the NCAA tournament, even though he participated in a light shoot-around Wednesday.
Jayhawks coach Bill Self said the 7-footer's status hasn't changed since Monday, when Embiid received a second opinion on his back from a specialist in Los Angeles. The doctor confirmed the initial diagnosis of a stress fracture and prescribed rest and rehabilitation.
Self also refuted reports that he was "100 percent" confident Embiid would play this postseason. Self would only say that Embiid was a longshot to play the first weekend of the NCAA tournament.
Tenth-ranked Kansas has a bye to the quarterfinals of the Big 12 tournament, where it will face Oklahoma State or Texas Tech on Thursday.
