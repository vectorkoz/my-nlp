GREENSBORO, N.C. –  Erik Swoope scored 14 points and hit the go-ahead basket with 2:42 left to help Miami beat Virginia Tech 57-53 in Wednesday's first round of the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament.
Rion Brown scored 15 points to lead the 10th-seeded Hurricanes (17-15), who hit four free throws in the final 8 seconds to hang on against the last-place Hokies (9-22). Miami shot just 39 percent but the reigning tournament champion did just enough to advance, hitting 16 of 19 free throws.
Swoope was credited with a block on Jarell Eddie under the basket when Eddie beat him to an offensive rebound after a missed free throw in the final seconds. Swoope got the rebound and hit two free throws with 2.5 seconds left to seal it.
Miami advanced to Thursday's second round to face seventh-seeded North Carolina State and league player of the year T.J. Warren.
