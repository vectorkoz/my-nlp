PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. –  Kolten Wong hit a two-run homer for the second straight day, and the St. Louis Cardinals beat the New York Mets 6-4 Wednesday.
Wong went 2 for 4 with a long home run to right off Kyle Farnsworth in the seventh that made it 4-0.
Stephen Piscotty went 2 for 3 with a double and triple. Juan Lagares had a two-run single for the Mets.
Cardinals starter Carlos Martinez, competing to be in the club's starting rotation, allowed two hits in four scoreless innings and struck out three.
Mets starter John Lannan, a non-roster invitee competing to be New York's fifth starter, gave up two runs — both unearned — and three hits in four innings. He struck out five and walked none.
