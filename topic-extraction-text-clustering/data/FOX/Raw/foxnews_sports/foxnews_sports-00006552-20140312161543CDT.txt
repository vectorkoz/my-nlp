TAMPA, Fla. –  Hiroki Kuroda gave up six runs and 10 hits over 3 2-3 innings Wednesday as the New York Yankees and Detroit Tigers played to a 7-7 tie in 10 innings.
Nick Castellanos drove in two runs with a double during Detroit's four-run, six-hit first inning against Kuroda. Trevor Crowe had a two-run double during the third.
Kuroda also faced the Tigers last Friday, allowing one hit, walking one and striking out five over 2 2-3 scoreless innings.
Anibal Sanchez allowed one run, three hits and struck out three in four innings for Detroit. The right-hander retired his first six batters before Francisco Cervelli hit a third-inning solo homer.
Sanchez also pitched against the Yankees last Friday, allowing two runs and four hits, including a long two-run homer to Carlos Beltran, in three innings.
Cervelli hit his second solo shot of the game in the fifth off Evan Reed.
