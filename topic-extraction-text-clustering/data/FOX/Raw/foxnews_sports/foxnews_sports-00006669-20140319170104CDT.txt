SPOKANE, Wash. –  The trendy pick to win the NCAA tournament: Michigan State.
The unlucky 13th seed that drew the Spartans: Delaware.
Fresh off its selection as President Barack Obama's pick to take the title, Michigan State (26-8) got down to the business of preparing for Thursday's game against Colonial Athletic Association champion Delaware (25-9).
Coach Tom Izzo says he has no problem with high expectations; the Spartans are among the favorites even though they're only seeded fourth in the East Region.
For the first time since January, Michigan State is fully healthy, led by junior Branden Dawson, who missed nine games with a broken hand but returned to win Most Valuable Player in the Big Ten tournament.
Delaware's Devon Saddler and Davon Usher each average more than 19 points a game.
