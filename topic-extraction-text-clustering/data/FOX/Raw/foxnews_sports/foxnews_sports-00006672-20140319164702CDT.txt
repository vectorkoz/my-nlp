MILWAUKEE –  No. 7 seed Oregon takes on 10th-seeded BYU in the NCAA tournament on Thursday in a rematch of a wild December game won by the Ducks.
Oregon trailed by 10 early in the second half, and then rallied for a 100-96 overtime victory over BYU. Reserve Jason Calliste led the way with a career-high 31 points.
The West Regional matchup of at-large teams comes almost exactly three months after the first game, and no one seems too sure of what still applies from that high-scoring Saturday night.
Oregon forward Mike Moser says Wednesday each team has grown since then, so it probably will be a really different game.
BYU will be without playmaking guard Kyle Collinsworth, who tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee in the WCC tournament.
