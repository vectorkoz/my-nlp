ST. LOUIS –  New Mexico players and coaches know from experience not to take anything for granted.
The same goes for Stanford, for different reasons.
The Lobos (27-6) were one and done as a No. 3 seed last March, taken down by Harvard. The Mountain West tournament champions are No. 7 in the Midwest Regional but would be firmly grounded in any case.
As for the 10th-seeded Cardinal, it's been a long wait to get to this point. The school is making its first NCAA appearance since 2008.
Dawkins' signature accomplishment in six seasons at Stanford (21-12) is an NIT title last season. His team is not peaking by any means, having lost four of seven.
