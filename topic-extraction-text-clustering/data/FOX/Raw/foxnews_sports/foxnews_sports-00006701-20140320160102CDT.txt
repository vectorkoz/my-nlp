SAN ANTONIO –  Four years ago, Louisiana-Lafayette coach Bob Marlin walked off the floor after a close loss at Creighton and reviewed the box score.
There in black and white was Doug McDermott's stat line: 12 points on 4-of-12 shooting to go with six rebounds in the freshman's third career game.
At the time, Marlin predicted McDermott would be a nice player.
What an understatement.
When No. 3-seed Creighton (26-7) and No. 14 Louisiana-Lafayette (23-11) meet again Friday in the second round of the West Regional, Marlin will see up close how that "nice player" has grown into a one of the country's most prolific scorers and a top contender for just about every national player of the year award as a senior.
