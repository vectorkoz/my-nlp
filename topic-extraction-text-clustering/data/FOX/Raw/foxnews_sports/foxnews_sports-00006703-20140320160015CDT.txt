CLEARWATER, Fla. –  Jose Bautista extended his torrid spring with a double and Esmil Rogers gave up just one run in five innings Thursday as the Blue Jays beat a Philadelphia Phillies split-squad 3-1.
Bautista went 1 for 3, and is now hitting .359 this spring with five homers, four doubles and 11 RBIs. Erik Kratz homered twice and was 3 for 3, and Moises Sierra also connected for Toronto.
Phillies starter David Buchanan gave up two of the homers but was sharp otherwise. Buchanan, who has a decent shot to make the team, gave up the two runs and struck out six in four innings. Buchanan started six games in Triple-A last year.
Tony Gwynn Jr. went 2 for 2 with a double, a run and a walk. Chase Utley drove in Gwynn with a first-inning double for the Phillies' only run.
