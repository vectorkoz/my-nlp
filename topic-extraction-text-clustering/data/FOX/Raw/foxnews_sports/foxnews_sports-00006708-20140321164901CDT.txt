BUFFALO, N.Y. –  Syracuse has had to deal with teams slowing play all season. Get ready for a change of pace.
When the third-seeded Orange (28-5) face No. 11 Dayton (24-10) in the South Region of the NCAA tournament on Saturday night, the Flyers expect to be flying against the Orange's vaunted 2-3 zone defense as the teams vie for a spot in the round of 16.
Dayton coach Archie Miller says the Flyers "have to amp up the pace of play. That game's got to be on the run."
Dayton advanced with a stirring 60-59 victory on Thursday over in-state foe Ohio State on Vee Sanford's layup with 3.8 seconds left. Syracuse advanced with a dominating 77-53 victory over Western Michigan to get back on track after having lost five of seven entering the tournament.
