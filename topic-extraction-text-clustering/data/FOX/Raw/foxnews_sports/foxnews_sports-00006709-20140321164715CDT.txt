SAN ANTONIO –  Doug McDermott scored 30 points and third-seeded Creighton got three huge 3-pointers in the second half from Ethan Wragge to beat No. 14 Louisiana-Lafayette 76-66 Friday in the West Regional.
McDermott had a double-double by halftime but went scoreless for nearly 14 minutes of the second half, leaving it to Wragge's long shots to bail out the Bluejays from a potential upset by Ragin' Cajuns, who attacked Creighton (27-7) with fearless defense and rebounding.
Sun Belt tournament champion Louisiana-Lafayette (23-12) led 50-48 before Wragge struck from long range to turn momentum.
The win means the Creighton family keeps marching on its final days together. McDermott, the nation's leading scorer, opted against going to the NBA after last season to play one more year with his father, Creighton coach Greg McDermott.
