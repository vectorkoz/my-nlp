WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. –  Purdue coach Sharon Versyp feels right at home this weekend. She's back in the building she starred in as a player, back in the NCAA tournament where the Boilermakers have been virtually unbeatable in the first round and back in a building that has been so good to Purdue.
If the fourth-seeded Boilermakers (21-8) follow the script Saturday against NCAA tourney newcomer Akron (23-9), Versyp will get her 300th career win in front of the home crowd, too. Fifth-seeded Oklahoma State (23-8) faces 12th-seeded Florida Gulf Coast (26-7) Saturday's first game.
The winners meet Monday night.
It won't be easy for Purdue.
Akron, the Mid-American Conference champs, are making their first NCAA appearance and have two of the nation's top 15 scorers this season and four 1,000-point scorers.
