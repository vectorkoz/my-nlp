DALLAS –  Trevor Daley and Jamie Benn scored third-period goals to help the Dallas Stars rally for a 3-1 victory over the Ottawa Senators on Saturday.
Dallas snapped a four-game losing streak (0-3-1) and sent the Senators to their sixth consecutive defeat (0-5-1), tying Ottawa's longest skid this season.
Jordie Benn had two assists for the Stars. Cody Eakin had tied the game with a second-period goal. Kari Lehtonen made 26 saves in his second game since returning from a head injury.
Erik Karlsson scored for Ottawa in the first period.
Daley's goal came after Senators goalie Robin Lehner stopped Colton Sceviour's shot. Dallas' Ray Whitney retrieved the puck and passed it to Daley.
Jamie Benn reached 30 goals for the first time in his five NHL seasons.
