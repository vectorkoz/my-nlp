ST. LOUIS –  Kentucky offered the promise of perfection. Wichita State is in pursuit of it.
The teams will meet Sunday for a spot in the Midwest Regional semifinals.
The eighth-seeded Wildcats are the team stocked with so much NBA talent that some of their brazen fans printed up T-shirts that read, "40-0." Before the season, mind you. And it's also the team that went exactly five days before losing its first game.
Meanwhile, the top-seeded Shockers are a bunch of small-town kids and overlooked prospects desperately trying not to wake up from a dream season. They're the team that can actually attain 40-0, only if they can finish off what they nearly accomplished last season.
Kentucky is the next obstacle standing Wichita State's way.
