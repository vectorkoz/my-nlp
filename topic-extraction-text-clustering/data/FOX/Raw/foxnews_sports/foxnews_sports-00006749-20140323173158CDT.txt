SAN DIEGO –  Jabari Parker was dejected after Duke's unexpected early loss in the NCAA tournament. Andrew Wiggins had a similar reaction after Kansas lost to Stanford in the third round.
Now the two talented freshmen — and a few others — face decisions about their futures sooner than they thought.
Wiggins has not been shy about saying he wants to leave for the NBA after one season, though was noncommittal after the Jayhawks' 60-57 loss to Stanford on Sunday. His teammates Joel Embiid and Wayne Selden will also have to think about whether they want to return to Lawrence.
Parker, a projected lottery pick like Wiggins, was similarly vague about his plans after the Blue Devils lost to No. 14 seed Mercer on Friday.
