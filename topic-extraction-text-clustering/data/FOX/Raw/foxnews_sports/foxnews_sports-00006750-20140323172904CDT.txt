MINNEAPOLIS –  Markieff Morris scored 25 points off the bench to lead the Phoenix Suns to their biggest comeback of the season, a 127-120 victory against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday.
Phoenix trailed by 22 in the first half but shot a season-high 57 percent from the floor to overcome Kevin Love 36 points and 14 rebounds. Love fell an assist short of a triple double and committed a crucial turnover in the final minute.
With the game tied at 118, Love lost the ball in the paint and Eric Bledsoe made a fast-break layup.
Gerald Green, Bledsoe and P.J. Tucker each hit a pair of free throws in the closing seconds to help the Suns pull within a half game of eighth-place Memphis in the Western Conference.
The Suns tied a season high by allowing 41 points in the first quarter and trailed 103-93 heading in the final period, but they outscored the Wolves 34-17 in the fourth. Minnesota, meanwhile, blew its largest lead of the season.
Phoenix has won five of its last six.
The Wolves scored a season-high 73 first-half points — they needed every one of them because the Suns shot 61 percent and still found themselves trailing by 11 at halftime.
Minnesota built its early lead thanks to a 14-0 first-quarter run fueled by a balanced offense. Every Wolves player who checked in scored. But Morris shot Phoenix back into the game with 15 points in the second quarter on 6 for 8 shooting.
Bledsoe had 21 points for the Suns, Tucker had 19 and Goran Dragic 18.
Notes: The officials hit Phoenix with four technical fouls, including one on an assistant coach. . Crews scrambled to prepare the court after Target Center hosted the National Collegiate Hockey Conference championship game Saturday night. They didn't have enough time to remove the ice, so they constructed the court above it for Sunday's game. . Wolves G J.J. Barea scored two points in his first game since spraining his left foot in Thursday's loss to Houston. Barea was questionable heading into the game but told coach Rick Adelman he felt better after warming up Sunday. . The Wolves have scored 30 points in the first quarter five straight games.
