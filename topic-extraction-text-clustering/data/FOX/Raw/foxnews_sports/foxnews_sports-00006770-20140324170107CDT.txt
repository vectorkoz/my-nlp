It's Kentucky and Louisville, one more time.
One of college basketball's fiercest rivalries takes center stage Friday night when the Wildcats and defending national champion Cardinals meet in the Sweet 16 in Indianapolis. The Bluegrass State showdown will take place at Lucas Oil Stadium, home of the NFL's Colts, which will be configured to hold 35,000 basketball fans.
Those seats will be filled with fans clad in blue and red gear, many of whom ill make the 3-hour drive for the game they wouldn't dare miss.
The schools have won the past two NCAA championships and are playing their best basketball of the season. Both fan bases expected their teams to reach the Midwest Region semifinal, and they also expect their schools to advance.
