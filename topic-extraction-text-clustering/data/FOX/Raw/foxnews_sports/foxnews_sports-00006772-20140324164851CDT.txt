WALTHAM, Mass. –  The four seniors and one graduate student starting for Bentley's unbeaten women's basketball team aren't focusing on how far they've come as a group.
Not when there's so much still to play for — the program's first NCAA championship.
The Falcons are 32-0 going into the Elite Eight. They're 121-11 in the past four seasons. But three of those losses came in the Final Four, Elite Eight and, last year, in the round of 16 where they lost to Dowling, 53-51.
The Falcons have taken that next step. And if they beat Drury (Mo.) on Tuesday night in Erie, Pa., they will be back in the Final Four.
