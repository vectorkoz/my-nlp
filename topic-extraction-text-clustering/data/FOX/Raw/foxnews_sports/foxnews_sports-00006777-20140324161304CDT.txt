BATON ROUGE, La. –  West Virginia coach Mike Carey would like to think the Mountaineers are due for a second-round win in the NCAA tournament.
The fact that the Mountaineers have arguably their best team in school history should help when WVU (30-4) takes on LSU (20-12) on Tuesday night.
The Mountaineers have lost all seven second-round games in program history, including five in the previous seven seasons.
This season, WVU has set a school record for victories, won the Big 12 regular-season title, and Carey says it's time for his program to take the next step.
LSU lost eight of 10 entering the tournament, but has the benefit of playing at home. The Lady Tigers also appeared to hit their stride in a 98-78 first-round victory over Georgia Tech.
