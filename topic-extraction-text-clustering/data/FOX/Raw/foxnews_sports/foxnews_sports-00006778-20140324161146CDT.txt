COLLEGE STATION, Texas –  Texas A&M is in the exact situation it was a year ago and playing in the same place.
Only this time the Aggies are determined to engineer a different outcome.
No. 3 seed Texas A&M hosts 11th-seeded James Madison in the second round of the NCAA tournament on Tuesday night. The Aggies try not to dwell on the past, but they can't help but think about last year's loss to Nebraska in the second round on their home court.
Texas A&M senior Karla Gilbert says: "That's definitely going to be in the back of our minds that we cannot allow that to happen again."
A win would put the Aggies in the round of 16 for the sixth time and first since 2012.
