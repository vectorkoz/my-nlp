STORRS, Conn. –  Top-ranked Connecticut plays Saint Joseph's on Tuesday night in the second round of the NCAA tournament. It's a game that has a lot of emotional ties for Huskies coach Geno Auriemma.
Auriemma grew up in Philadelphia as a Saint Joe's fan. He coached high school ball and became good friends with Phil Martelli, who coaches the Hawks' men's team, and got his first college coaching job as an assistant for the women's team with the Hawks in 1978.
He also coached the mother of Saint Joseph's guard Erin Shields and the sister of Hawks coach Cindy Griffin.
Auriemma will put that aside as the Huskies (35-0) attempt to win their 42nd consecutive game and move into the regional semifinals for a 21st straight time.
