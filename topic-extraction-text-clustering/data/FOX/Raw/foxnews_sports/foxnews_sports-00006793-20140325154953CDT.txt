DENVER –  The Denver Nuggets say forward J.J. Hickson had surgery to repair a torn ligament in his right knee on Tuesday.
Hickson hurt his ACL early in the fourth quarter of Denver's loss at Dallas last Friday, when he went down along the baseline. This has been an injury-riddled season for the Nuggets, who were already without Danilo Gallinari, JaVale McGee and Nate Robinson after they each had season-ending operations.
The 25-year-old Hickson averaged 11.8 points and 9.2 rebounds this season. He also had a team-high 26 double-doubles.
Nuggets general manager Tim Connelly said of Hickson: "We know he will attack his rehab with the same energy and hard work that he displays on the court every night."
