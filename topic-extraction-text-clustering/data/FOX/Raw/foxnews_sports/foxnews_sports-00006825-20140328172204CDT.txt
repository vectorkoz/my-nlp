ANAHEIM, Calif. –  Arizona's Sean Miller and Wisconsin's Bo Ryan are one win from their first trip to the Final Four.
In the only 1-2 matchup in the Elite Eight, top-seeded Arizona will play No. 2 seed Wisconsin in the West Regional final on Saturday.
The Wildcats (33-4) have not been able to get out of the regional in Anaheim in three previous tries, dating to 1998. With eight weeks at No. 1 and 21 straight victories during the season, they want to deliver for Miller, who has restored the program's luster in his five years.
The Badgers (29-7) haven't been to the Final Four since 2000, shortly before Ryan took over in Madison. He turned 69 earlier this week, and the team is feeling a sense of urgency to deliver for a coach, who in the words of guard Josh Gasser, is "getting up there."
