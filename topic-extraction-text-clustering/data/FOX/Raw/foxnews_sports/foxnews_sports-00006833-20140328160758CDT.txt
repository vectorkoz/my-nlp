MEMPHIS, Tenn. –  The Dayton Flyers are feeling very confident and loose with the upsets they've already pulled this NCAA tournament. They're also ready to wreck what's left of anyone's bracket with their greatest challenge ahead and a trip to the Final Four on the line.
Enter the Florida Gators, the overall top seed.
While the 11th-seeded Flyers already have exceeded expectations going into Saturday's South Regional final, the Gators are driven too. They talk of chasing greatness, trying to add to a 29-game winning streak that's the best in school history. Florida also is back in the Elite Eight having lost here the past three years.
Senior Patric Young says the Gators have learned lessons from those losses and won't be haunted by their past as they try to advance.
