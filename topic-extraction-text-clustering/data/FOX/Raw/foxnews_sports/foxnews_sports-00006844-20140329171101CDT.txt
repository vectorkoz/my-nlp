ROME, Ga. –  Mike Minor retired all four batters he faced in his first game this spring, and the Atlanta Braves lost 13-4 to the Braves Future Stars in an exhibition game Saturday.
Minor will open the season on the 15-day disabled list as he recovers from tendinitis in his left shoulder. He said he felt good in his rain-shortened start against Atlanta prospects.
The Braves need a healthy Minor after losing starting pitchers Kris Medlen and Brandon Beachy to season-ending elbow injuries.
General manager Frank Wren announced Saturday that reliever Cory Gearrin has a "significant" ligament injury in his right elbow. Wren said Gearrin will see Dr. James Andrews next week for a second opinion.
Former Braves manager Bobby Cox managed the Future Stars.
