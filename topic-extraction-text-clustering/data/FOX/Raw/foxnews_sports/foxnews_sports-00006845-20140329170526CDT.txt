OAKLAND, Calif. –  The scheduled exhibition finale between the San Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics on Saturday was canceled because of rain.
A steady downpour forced a delay of more than an hour, and the ground crew covered the infield with a silver tarp before officials decided to call off the game, sending home a crowd that was expected to be near 30,000.
Oakland opens the regular season Monday at home against the Cleveland Indians. San Francisco plays its opener in Arizona.
