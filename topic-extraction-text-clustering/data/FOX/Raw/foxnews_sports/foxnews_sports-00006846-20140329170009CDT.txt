LOUISVILLE, Ky. –  Louisville knows that LSU will be a different team than the one it routed in November.
Not only do the seventh-seeded Tigers (21-12) enter Sunday's regional semifinal confident following their second-round upset of No. 2 seed West Virginia, they're unfazed by losing Jeanne Kenney and Raigyne Moncrief to injury in each of their NCAA tournament victories.
Louisville coach Jeff Walz quickly notes how LSU has overcome that adversity, an important fact he hopes his third-seeded Cardinals (32-4) remember because the Lady Tigers are hungry to prove they can play through their obstacles.
LSU also might want to settle a score against the Cardinals after getting pasted 88-67 by them in the preseason WNIT. Louisville has opened with two lopsided tournament wins, but Walz has warned his team not to be overconfident.
