SAN ANTONIO –  Jesus Guzman and George Springer hit consecutive home runs in the first inning, Jonathan Meyer had a grand slam in the fifth and the Houston Astros rolled to a 13-6 victory over the Texas Rangers in the Alamodome on Saturday.
Nolan Fontana added a three-run shot in the seventh to help the Astros sweep two weekend games in the Alamodome, designed primarily for football and special events such as the NCAA Final Four. With an odd configuration for baseball, the building hosted Rangers spring training games for the second straight year.
Texas opens the regular season Monday afternoon at home against the Philadelphia Phillies.
Houston plays El Aguila de Veracruz in its exhibition finale Sunday before hosting the New York Yankees in the season opener Tuesday night.
