MARTINSVILLE, Va. –  The NASCAR Truck Series race at Martinsville Speedway was rained out Saturday and will be made up as part of a rare doubleheader Sunday.
NASCAR says the Sprint Cup race will start at 1:13 p.m., and the hope is the Truck Series race can start by about 5:30 p.m.
The tricky part will not only be cooperation from the weather, but a smooth Cup race because Martinsville Speedway, the oldest in the premier series, does not have lights.
The track says tickets for both races will be honored, with the caveat that ticket holders with truck tickets only will have to wait until 100 laps have been run in the Cup race to enter the track.
