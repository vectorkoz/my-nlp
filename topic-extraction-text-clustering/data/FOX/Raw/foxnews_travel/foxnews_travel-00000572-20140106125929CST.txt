BOSTON –  JetBlue is suspending most operations in New York and Boston through Tuesday morning as it deals with widespread cancelations during a winter freeze.
JetBlue Airways Corp. said Monday it would stop most flights at Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark Liberty airports in the New York area and Boston's Logan Airport though 10 a.m. EST on Tuesday. It said regular service wouldn't resume until Tuesday afternoon.
The decision was made in light of weather forecasts that call for temperatures around zero and possible flash freezing.
The company said it also needed time for crews to rest and for technicians to service planes.
Some passengers have been stuck at Logan for two days, sleeping on cots and in concourse chairs.
