Snow and ice has never looked this good. 10,000 workers assembled this frosty village in only 15 days.
Even with temperatures at record lows in the U.S., you may still be dreaming of a true cold weather escape. Head straight to China for the 30th Harbin International Ice and Snow Festival.  
With frozen rivers, icy tunnels and even snowy slides, this man-made winter wonderland has everything. The entire display was cut, carved and built by some 10,000 workers in just 15 days. Over six million cubic feet of ice and five million cubic feet of snow was used to create the lifelike frozen village. 
This is one of the region's most popular attractions with over a million tourists expected to visit the site. The festival this year boasts a replica of Rome's Colosseum, temples from Asia and sky-high snow castles. Many of the sculptures light up the night with bursts of color.
The festival opened Jan. 5 in China’s Heilongjiang province and will be on display for the next few weeks, cold-friendly weather permitting.
