If you’re deeply afraid of flying and planning to render yourself unconscious for an upcoming flight -- this article is for you.
The airline safety review site AirlineRatings.com has just released a comprehensive list of the world's safest airlines. So no need to load up on sleeping pills and benzos – unless that’s your thing -- just choose one of the safer airlines out there.
Topping the list for the safest carriers of 2013 is the Australian airline Qantas. The airline was awarded a full seven stars, the highest rating possible. The website cited the airline's fatality-free flying record since the dawn of the jet era.
Flight-phobics, you’re in luck. According to the Aviation Safety Network (ASN), last year was the safest for flying since 1945, with 269 deaths from 29 accidents.
"The average number of airliner accidents has shown a steady and persistent decline," ASN president, Harro Ranter told CNN. "Probably for a great deal thanks to the continuing safety-driven efforts by international aviation organizations." That may explain why of the 448 airlines AirlineRatings.com reviewed, 137 have a top seven-star rating. Other airlines sharing Qantas’ seven-star rating and winning a place among the top 10 safest airlines are:  Air New Zealand, All Nippon Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways, Emirates, Etihad Airways, Eva Air, Royal Jordanian, Singapore Airlines and Virgin Atlantic.
As for the riskier airlines, Scat, the unfortunately named Kazakh airline, received a one-star ranking along with the Afghan Kam Air and the Surinamese Bluewing Airlines.
If you’re really an adventure-lover, hop a flight on one of these airlines – which are all banned from flying within the E.U. As for best major U.S. carriers, Alaska Airlines took home the win according to the Wall Street Journal’s annual scorecard of airline service.
At the top with Alaska was Delta, which for the past two years has posted better results than its competitors. United and American Airlines were ranked the worst among major U.S. carriers.
Of course, if you’re really going for top safety record, you’re going to have to fly a non-U.S. carrier.
In the words of Rain Man’s Raymond Babbit, “Qantas never crashed.”
