A man fell asleep on a plane with his finger on the slash key.YouTube
We know that poor ventilation can sometimes leave airline passengers feeling sleepy.
But one busy traveler drifted off on his flight --but not before he took his finger off his laptop keyboard.
A video uploaded on YouTube showing the sleeping man with his finger stuck pushing the '////////////' key on his keyboard went viral, and has been watched over 620,000 times since it was posted Friday.
Entitled “Dude sleeping on jet w/finger on slash key,” it was apparently shot by his seat mate. At least the man didn’t start snuggling up to his fellow passenger like this woman did back in July.
