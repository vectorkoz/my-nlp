OMAHA, Neb. –  Anyone traveling to Omaha this spring could benefit if Peyton Manning shouts "Omaha" at least 50 times in Sunday's AFC championship game.
The Denver Broncos quarterback said "Omaha" 44 times in last week's game. The Broncos play the New England Patriots on Sunday.
The Hotels.com travel site says it will offer a 15 percent discount on Omaha hotels through June 1 if Manning yells about Nebraska's largest city at least 50 times.
Five Omaha companies have also pledged to donate $500 to Manning's foundation for at-risk youth for every time he shouts "Omaha."
So Manning's "Omaha" calls from the line-of-scrimmage could pay off if he doesn't change his routine to throw off the Patriots.
