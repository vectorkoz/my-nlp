LAS VEGAS –  Two casinos in downtown Las Vegas plan to start accepting the online currency Bitcoin.
The D casino and the city's oldest casino, the Golden Gate, will accept Bitcoin at their hotel front desks beginning Wednesday. Bitcoins can also be used at the D's gift shop and two restaurants. They won't be accepted on the casino floor.
The co-owner of the D and the Golden Gate, Derek Stevens, says he's been intrigued by the currency for years and had talked with patrons who wondered if the casinos would use it.
Stevens says it's tough to forecast how many patrons will pay for their rooms and dinners with Bitcoin, but he predicts other casinos will start adopting it in the future.
