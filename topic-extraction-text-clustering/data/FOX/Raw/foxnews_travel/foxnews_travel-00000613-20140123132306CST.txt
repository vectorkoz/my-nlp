ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. –  New Jersey's seaside gambling resort is taking its show on the road, targeting partiers in Philadelphia with a mobile nightclub that will bring 300 of them back to Atlantic City to experience the resort's nightspots.
It's also launching social media efforts to recruit fun-seekers to come to Atlantic City.
The outreach is part of the $30 million annual campaign by the Atlantic City Alliance to promote the resort as more than just a gambling center.
"Atlantic City is a lively destination all year round," said Liza Cartmell, the group's president. "These promotions are designed with specific social media components included in order to showcase all that there is to do here even during the coldest months. We encourage visitors to enjoy the indoor pools, spas, restaurants, shopping, nightclubs, entertainment and gambling, and share their experiences over social media with their friends."
The Alliance unveiled three campaigns Thursday aimed at winter tourism.
One, Do AC Nightlife, features a 45-foot-long vehicle to take partygoers in the Philadelphia region to Atlantic City for a VIP night on the town. Over four weeks, 300 people will be given luxury rides to and from Atlantic City nightspots.
Another campaign, Show Us Your Bling, is aimed at female travelers looking for a group getaway for such events as bachelorette parties. Recently engaged couples are encouraged to upload a picture of their engagement bling at www.doatlanticcity.com , or on Facebook. They can also submit via Instagram, Twitter or Vine with the hashtag #ShowUsYourBling by March 14.
One couple will win bachelor and bachelorette parties at Atlantic City locations that were featured last summer on the ABC show "The Bachelorette."
The last campaign, Taste Of Summer, features pools, spas and summer cocktails at all 11 of the city's casinos, with sand sculptures and beach balls in many of the lobbies.
