If you’re one of the millions of people whose New Year’s resolution is to travel more, you may be asking where you can go to get the biggest bang for your hard-earned buck. One of Hotwire’s goals is to help travelers take their dream vacations at affordable prices, so we’ve pinpointed some fantastic destinations that are shaping up to be great deal spots in 2014. These destinations are more than just affordable – they’re also places not to be missed. In fact, our recent American Travel Behavior Survey found that these are some of the most sought-after travel locations for the New Year. Here is our list of the top deal destinations of 2014. Domestic 1.  New York City I know you what you must be thinking: New York, a deal destination? You’ve got to be kidding me! The most sought-after destination for 2014 is well-known for high prices, but the Big Apple is experiencing an influx of new hotel rooms, which will result in lower prices as they compete for bookings. May and September tend to be the most popular periods of the year, but sports fans thinking about a last-minute trip for the Super Bowl –or even shortly after --shouldn’t have to worry about booking a room; given the increased supply, hoteliers are finding that they have extra rooms left over, which is resulting in great deals even as the event draws closer. Sample deal: $119 per night for a 4-star hotel in the Madison Square Garden-Hell’s Kitchen area (stays for 2/7 – 2/9/14) 2.  Los Angeles
Los Angeles will always be a popular travel destination due to its year-round welcoming weather and its many tourist-friendly attractions, but last year we noticed that a major reason for its popularity was its ability to keep prices low throughout the year, even during times when prices generally spike. Summer in LA, for instance, is usually packed with visitors in places like Disneyland and the coastal areas, but last year those fronts remained relatively peaceful. We expect this trend to continue this year, with February being quite a deal month as none of the big awards shows fall within that month. Visitors should be sure to enjoy local landmarks like the Staples Center for sporting and concert events, the Third Street Promenade for shopping and communities like Little Tokyo, Little Armenia and Korea Town for some unique cultural experiences. Sample deal: $91 per night for a 4-star hotel in the Redondo Beach-Hermosa Beach area (stays for 2/7 – 2/9/14) 3. Washington, D.C. 2013 was a mixed year for Washington travel. Some exciting events spiked foot traffic, including the Presidential Inauguration and the 100th anniversary of the Cherry Blossom Festival. But government sequesters and shutdowns also put a damper on travel. It’s projected that government travel may take a hit this year due to tighter travel restrictions, so prices are expected to remain pretty low in an attempt to normalize demand. This year is a great opportunity for those who hope to visit our nation’s capital at a bargain. The great thing is, even though D.C. is expected to have fewer visitors in 2014 that doesn’t mean  that there will be a change in the quality of activities to do there. It’s still home to several charming communities, and while you may have missed the Cherry Blossom Festival’s centennial celebration, it’s still a beautiful spring experience. Other D.C. events include the George Washington birthday parade on Presidents Day, as well as the many St. Patrick’s Day parades and events that take place in D.C. and the surrounding areas. Sample deal: $74 per night for a 4-star hotel in the White House - Downtown area (stays for 2/7 – 2/9/14) 4.  Atlanta
We don’t often talk about Atlanta, but this year it’s poised to offer some great deals and plenty of things to do. Compared to last year, Atlanta is expected to see a bit of a slump in conventions, which makes the destination much less busy on the business front and much more welcoming to leisure travelers. With a high number of hotels having just come on board with Hotwire in 2013, this year will see a high volume of discount offerings, which translates to better rates for anyone looking to visit the City in the Woods. In addition, Atlanta offers a slew of events throughout the year. The Perry Dogwood festival, for instance, features art, music, contests and a hot-air balloon rally that is sure to create enough picturesque memories to last a lifetime. Sample deal: $106 per night for a 4.5-star hotel in the midtown area (stays for 2/7 – 2/9/14) International
1.  Berlin
We’re continuing to expand our inventory in European destinations, and this year we’ll be adding lots of rooms in places like Berlin. For example, we recently added a new 5-star property fit for a king that boasts spectacular rooms and a central location by the Berlin Zoological Garden – one of the oldest and most famous zoos in all of Germany. This hotel is a dream for those looking to get luxury for less, but overall the hotel market in Berlin tends to stay affordable year-round and is teeming with impressive deals no matter when you plan to visit. Early visitors to Berlin can enjoy various large-scale events, including the Berlinale International Film Festival, which shows upwards of 400 films and is filled with fashion, art, and one of the largest audiences for any event of its kind. Fitness junkies can cheer on participants in the Velothon Berlin – a large bicycle race that passes by many Berlin landmarks. Sample deal: $109 per night for a 5-star hotel in the City Center – Tiergarten – Berlin Zoo area (stays for 2/7 – 2/9/14) 2.  Madrid
Traditionally, Madrid has been a very popular destination for business travel, which was enough to fill up hotel rooms. But business travel has gone down a bit lately, which is allowing for many more hotel vacancies, which in turn has led to many noteworthy discounts on hotel prices. Much like the city of Prague, Madrid is offering incredible rates on 5-star properties. Along with some unbeatable 2014 hotel prices, Madrid boasts amazing dining, high-end shopping and, for anyone hoping to see star player Cristiano Ronaldo in action, the Real Madrid soccer team. Sample deal: $65 per night for a 4-star hotel in the Royal Palace – Gran Via – Shopping area (stays for 2/7 – 2/9/14) 3. Amsterdam
Amsterdam is a great European travel spot for 2014. As we’re seeing in many other popular European destinations, it’s had quite a few hotels open in the past couple of years, and in 2014 it will see a noticeable drop in city-wide conferences. This will lead to greater availability, which will cause hotel prices to drop for travelers on the hunt for discount stays. If you want to visit during a major national event, Amsterdam this year will host King’s Day – an event that has been called “Queen’s Day” since 1890 but will be changed for 2014 to celebrate King Willem-Alexander, who has succeeded his mother, Queen Beatrix, as the country’s monarch. The festivities, which will take place on April 27, the King’s birthday, include an all-orange dress code, as well as a nationwide market event where citizens sell their secondhand goods. Sample deal: $98 per night for a 4-star hotel in the Museum Quarter - Vondelpark area (stays for 2/7 – 2/9/14) Hotel sample rates are based on searches made on Hotwire.com on 1/15/14 for stays 2/7 – 2/9/14.
