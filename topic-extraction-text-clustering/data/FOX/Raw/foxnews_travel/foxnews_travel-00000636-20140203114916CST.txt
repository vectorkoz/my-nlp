Organizers say that plans for the world’s first robotics theme park plans are back on track after being delayed by environmental concerns. 
Construction for Masan Robot Land, a $660 million attraction in Incheon, South Korea, began in December. Gizmag.com reports that a new timeline for phase one of the proposed park calls for a full park opening in 2016.  Phase two, which will include a hotels and condos, is expected to open in 2018.
The complex will include a robot research and development center, a convention center, a robot exhibition hall, and a robot theme park. 
Inside the park, visitors will be able to visit three unique worlds – Robot City, Kidbot Village and Robot Kingdom. Attractions will include an interactive robot aquarium, robot-themed roller coasters and an auto factory that introduces visitors to a robotic automotive assembly line. There will also be a 364-foot tall statue of the giant robot hero Taekwon V, a.k.a. Voltar the Invincible.
The ambitious project will also serve as an education center with facilities for research and development, a graduate-level robotics school and a robotics institute.
The South Korean government first announced initial plans for the "edutainment" complex in 2007, but the project had been put on hold while environmental reviews were completed. 
Robot Land will join several other popular amusement parks located in South Korea, including the Everland theme park and the more bizarre toilet-theme park in Suwon. Robot Land is expected to draw almost 3 million tourists annually when it is completed.
