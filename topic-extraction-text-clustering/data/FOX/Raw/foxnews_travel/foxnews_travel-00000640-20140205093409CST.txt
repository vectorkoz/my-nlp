We’ve all heard of the Mile-High Club but what about the Mile-Low Club? If you’ve ever wondered what true romance is like deep below the sea, then your time has finally come.
U.K.-based Oliver’s Travels recently announced the latest in aquatic luxury, launched just in time for Valentine's Day.  
This romantic submarine package, using speciality adapted submarines aptly named Lovers Deep, will send couples into secluded isolation below the sea and caters to every romantic whim, according to The Daily Mail.  Passengers can enjoy stunning marine views while cuddling down below, and they can feast on a unique, aphrodisiac tasting menu with dishes like oysters, caviar and a chocolate fondant with essence of pomegranate.  There is even a petal-scattering service and a champagne breakfast in bed.
“All of our handpicked, luxury properties have something unique and quirky about them, but Lovers Deep really stands out as one of our quirkiest yet," Oliver Bell, co-founder of Oliver's Travels, stated in a press release. Bell admits that this particular journey may be off the table for claustrophobic guests.
Customers get to pick where they want to go--be it a coral reef off the coast of St. Lucia or a sunken battleship in the Red Sea, say the travel company. During the voyage, guests can dive down as far as 650 ft. below the ocean's surface --talk about leaving the world behind. Of course, such exclusivity doesn't come cheap. Custom packages for the Mile-Low Club begin around $284,000.
We won’t hold our breath for a discount on this amorous adventure.
