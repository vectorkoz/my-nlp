Chocolate and flowers are so old school.  This month, as we celebrate all things romantic, it’s easy to come up with something original.  Here are five ideas to get you started:.
Explore a new part of a favorite city
New York, Chicago, Boston: They're all great options for a quick and romantic getaway. For example, opt for the  all-suite Conrad New York, in the heart of Lower Manhattan’s  Battery Park City, which is touting a Romance Retreat package with champagne, chocolate covered strawberries, breakfast in bed and more. In Boston, the Revere Hotel boasts of the Screaming Orgasm Package, complete with a private mixology lesson where couples will shake up X-Rated cocktails.  
Cuddle up in a B&B
Bed and Breakfasts offer up lots of unique options. At the Annville Inn in Annville, Pa. you might be able to engrave a brick that leads to the Romance Garden. Or take a five-hour private wine tasting in Santa Barbara when you book the Vintner’s Package at the Inn on Summer HiIl. Or take a kayak tour at the Shamrock Thistle &Crown in Central Florida.
Indulge in your favorite sweet treats 
Hershey, Pa. is celebrating its 10th year of Chocolate-Covered February, a month-long, town-wide celebration of all things chocolate. Over the last sweet decade, events and activities for all ages and tastes have honored chocolate—everything from chocolate spa treatments, Wine & Chocolate Pairing, special desert buffets, and chocolate martinis.  In New York, Sugartooth Tours offers special tours that include six tastings: Think chocolate truffles, hot chocolate, cupcakes, cookies and the option to add a wine/beer paring at the tour’s final destination.  You don’t have to feel guilty either because for each tour booked, a donation is made to a local nonprofit providing programs for under-served kids.
Celebrate your impeding arrival
Don't forget to take that babymoon vacation.  Pick somewhere romantic like at the adults-only, all-inclusive Casa Velas  in Puerto Vallarta complete with spa treatments, a handy book of baby names if you're still debating, and professional photographs to remember that last trip before kids.
Get outdoors   
Not only should you convene with Mother Nature, try something you’ve never done together. Take a paddle board lesson. Go snowshoeing. The Trapp Family Lodge—yes that family—in Stowe Vt. is famous for their  XC and snowshoe trails. Go go tubing -- did you know that Winter Park, Colo.  boasts more tubing hills than any other Colorado destination? Some of the slopes even have lights to create an exhilarating experience after dark.
