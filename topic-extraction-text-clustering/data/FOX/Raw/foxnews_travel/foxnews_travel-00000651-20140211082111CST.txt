Imagine walking into the airport and being greeted by name or getting the latest information on your flight.
Virgin Atlantic is testing the use of Google Glass and the Sony Smartwatch 2 at Heathrow airport to give customers what they say is a more personalized service.  
Staff at the upper class wing — which is for business class passengers — will be wearing the devices at check in and will update passengers on flight information, weather, translate foreign languages or inform them about local events happening at their destination.
This personalized service can also store preferences for future trips.
“From the minute Upper Class passengers step out of their chauffeured limousine at Heathrow’s T3 and are greeted by name, Virgin Atlantic staff wearing the technology will start the check-in process,” Virgin Atlantic said in a press release.
Virgin Atlantic said the technology could even be used to sync up passengers' dietary restrictions and flight snack preferences. 
Currently, the devices are only being used as travelers enter Virgin Atlantic’s Upper Class Wing and not for regular economy passengers.  Let's hope they can invent a technology that keeps babies quiet on longer flights.
