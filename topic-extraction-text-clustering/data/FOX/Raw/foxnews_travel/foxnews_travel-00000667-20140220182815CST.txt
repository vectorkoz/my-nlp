Southwest Airlines says it will stop flights in Chicago as another winter storm brings rain and high winds through the American Midwest.
Nationwide on Thursday, U.S. airlines had canceled about 650 flights and another 3,000 were delayed by mid-afternoon, according to tracking service FlightAware.com.
Southwest spokeswoman Michelle Agnew says all flights after 4 p.m. at Midway Airport — the airline's biggest base — will be canceled. That pushes Southwest's cancellations Thursday to 170 in Chicago and 190 overall, the most among major U.S. airlines.
At nearby O'Hare Airport, a hub for American Airlines and United Airlines, about one in 10 flights are canceled and one in four are running late. United Express, which operates smaller planes, canceled 70 flights.
