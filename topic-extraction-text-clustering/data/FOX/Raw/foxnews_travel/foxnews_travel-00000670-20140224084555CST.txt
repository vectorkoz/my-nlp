Looking for the ultimate thrill ride in Las Vegas? One the world’s largest indoor theme parks has a brand new coaster that reaches speeds of up to 45 mph and has twists and turns that are not for the feint of heart.
EL Loco is now open in the Adventuredome at CircusCircus. Only the second of its kind in the U.S., the entire ride is only 72 seconds long but features a harrowing 90-degree drop, a donut roll and a 180-degree turn, while hitting top speeds of 45 mph.  
The smaller, four-person cars allow for tight turns along 1,300 feet of vibrant yellow track. Surround sound speakers blast rock, hip-hop and Latin beats during the ride.
Most rides in this five-acre playground are geared toward the younger set, who have few other places to let loose on the Strip. But El Loco is definitely for a slightly older crowd--guests must be at least 4 feet tall to ride it.
El Loco is the latest attraction on the famous Vegas Strip, which includes other rides like The Big Apple Coaster at New York-New York and X Scream on top of the Stratosphere. Adventuredome bills itself as the largest indoor theme park in America and has over 25 attractions.
Unlike a day at the penny slots, El Loco thrills might be more likely to live up to the cost of admission. Tickets are $10 per ride or $30 for an all-day pass that includes admission to all Adventuredome rides.
