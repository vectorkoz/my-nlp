It’s always nice to be called attractive, but when a website lists you as a public “attraction” it’s a completely different story.
This week, a middle-aged Scottish mother of two saw she was named as the 87th most popular tourist attraction in Glasgow, Scotland, after finding herself listed as a museum on the tourism review site TripAdvisor.
The 60-year-old woman, Mary Johnston, managed to get four five-star reviews and outrank the popular Glasgow concert venue The Hydro, where superstar Beyonce recently performed.
“I didn’t set it up. It must be a bug in the system or it is malicious,” Johnston told the Scotsman. “I’m already a user and I went on recently to review somewhere in Amsterdam so it may have happened then…I have been reading forums and apparently you have to bend over backwards to set up an account as an attraction. At least it is a good picture of me.”
The listing, which has since been deleted, offered no details about Mary as an “attraction," but the website’s automatically generated text asked “Been to Mary Johnston? Share your experience.”
And several reviewers did share their experiences visiting Johnston, which TripAdvisor, using a sideways photograph of the woman, compared to several “similar” attractions like as Bellahouston Park and Pollok Country Park.
“This attraction wasn’t in the guidebooks but is fun for all the family if you’re a fan of people called Mary or rotationally-challenged photos,” wrote one reviewer called Perrierdoumbe. “The doorman seemed a bit grumpy though and didn’t seem to want to let us in.” Another reviewer lauded her “astounding Maryness” and recommended the woman as “the highlight of any trip” to the Scottish city.
I left my review for #MaryDoll. How about you? http://t.co/9HgvxArHJ3 pic.twitter.com/94ceRVaA55

Johnston quickly contacted TripAdvisor about the glitch and she is no longer listed as a top attraction for Glasgow.
