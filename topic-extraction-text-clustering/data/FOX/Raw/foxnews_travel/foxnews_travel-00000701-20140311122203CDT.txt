People-to-people exchange tours in Cuba have opened up academic, educational, sports, cultural, scientific and other exchanges between Cuba and the U.S.  See the beauty of this land through the lens of Jim Kane with Culture Xplorers.
More than half a million Americans are traveling to Cuba legally every year.
Though the U.S. still  prohibits Americans from spending money in Cuba, people-to-people visas have allowed for academic, educational, sports, cultural, scientific and other exchanges to occur.
While it is impossible to neatly sum up Cuba in a handful of images, these photos, collectively, show something of the irrepressible, complex and mesmerizing spirit of Cuba and its people today. This photo journey across the once forbidden isle is from the eye and lens of Jim Kane who, through his company Culture Xplorers organizes in-depth people-to-people exchange tours to Cuba.
