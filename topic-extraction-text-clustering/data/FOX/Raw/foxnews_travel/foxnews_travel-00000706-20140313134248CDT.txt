It’s a frozen fantasy. 
Sweden’s swanky Ice Hotel is offering guests the chance to design a $231,000 per-night suite made of ice, and after they check out the suite just melts away.
The pricey suites, which rank among the most expensive in the world, will be made from ice from the river Torne and will include original handmade artwork.  Guests will be involved in the design process and get to work up close with the ice.
Each suite will take two weeks to create and will last for only a few months. 
"The beauty of ice is that it only exists briefly and then goes away, it unleashes an incredible creativity in people," Arne Bergh, creative director of the Ice Hotel.
The Ice Hotel near the village of Jukkasjärvi, Kiruna, Sweden is about 125 miles from the Arctic  Circle. Since 1990, the hotel's entire contents, including the tables, chairs and beds, which are constructed from snow and ice blocks, has been built each year.
The suites, like much of the hotel, will be left to melt into the river with the spring. Guests will be given a bottle containing some of the melted ice, along with the sketches and blueprints for the design, and photographs of the suite.
The resort is offering the “haute couture travel experience” for stays between December and March, 2015.
