MANILA, Philippines –  Paris Hilton unveiled her first real estate project Thursday in metropolitan Manila and said she wants to follow in the footsteps of her great-grandfather and grandfather, who led a luxury hotel empire.
Hilton inaugurated the urban Paris Beach Club, which she designed in collaboration with Philippine developer Century Properties. The bean-shaped, three-story club fronting a man-made beach is within the resort-themed Azure condominium community in Paranaque City.
The 33-year-old businesswoman has acted in television and films and worked on perfumes and other projects, but she said the new project is just a start to more property ventures.
"This is probably the one project I'm most proud about because real estate is something that runs in my blood," Hilton said.
She told reporters that ever since she was a little girl she had looked up to her great-grandfather and grandfather and she had "incredible mentors." Conrad Hilton bought his first hotel in Texas in 1919, and his son, Barron Hilton, later led the family business.
"So I always really admired them and want to follow their footsteps," Hilton added. "This is my first step towards it and I'm so proud and honored to be doing this with Century Properties."
Century Properties Chairman Jose E.B. Antonio said the company is developing another resort-themed property in northern Pampanga province and Hilton will also be involved in that.
