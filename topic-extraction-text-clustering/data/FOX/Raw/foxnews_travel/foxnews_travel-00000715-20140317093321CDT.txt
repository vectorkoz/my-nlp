One woman is making a stink after the Transportation Security Administration confiscated her expensive bottle of designer perfume at the airport because agents said it looked like a grenade. 
Country music promoter and frequent traveler Lois Lewis was stopped by TSA agents and investigated by a bomb expert at Phoenix's Sky Harbor after trying to bring her 2-ounce bottle of Jimmy Choo perfume in her carryon, reports KTKV. 
Lewis said that she placed the $83-a-bottle perfume, which was within security guidelines, in a clear plastic bag and sent it through the scanner. 
The TSA prohibits any toy weapons or other items that look like weapons to be brought on board because it can be perceived as a threat.  Last month, security at Heathrow airportconfiscated a tiny toy gun off a Woody doll from "Toy Story."
When the TSA agents saw the perfume bottle, they shut down a lane at the Southwest Terminal for nearly an hour to investigate. 
"I'm not a casual traveler. I was trying to show them look I'm PreCheck. My risk has been assessed you know. I carry this with me always," said Lewis. "They said if as a passenger you were to get on an airplane and you were to wave this around that people could maybe construe that as you making some sort of a threat."
Lewis explains that the expert took down her information, copied her identification and then confiscated the bottle.
"I went from humorous to, alright let's be real. It's perfume," said Lewis.
Undeterred, she bought a new bottle in Denver, but this time Lewis said she decided to pack it in her checked luggage.   But she believes that her bag was searched because the perfume was outside of its plastic covering. 
"I know the TSA is there to protect us. I know that. I am a traveler. I travel a lot, many many flights a year. I have a husband. I want to come home. I want to be safe. But I want to be logical," said Lewis told KTVK.
