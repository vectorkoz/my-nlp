The five star property that Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace once called home is now a boutique hotel. 
With 10 bedrooms and 11 bathrooms across a sprawling 23,000-square-foot property, The Villa by Barton G. has retained its extravagant charm of the designer.
Located on Miami’s star studded Ocean Drive, the mansion features a 54-foot mosaic-tiled swimming pool lined in 24-carat gold, an original feature designed by Versace. According to the website, all bedrooms, outfitted in Egyptian cotton linens, have their own private balcony or patio and luxurious Italian marble bathrooms.
Signature Versace touches are featured prominently throughout the property, including pebble mosaics and elaborate frescoes on the ceilings. The website boasts that “The Villa By Barton G. provides the ultimate sensory experience,” and makes an ideal location not just as a home away from home but a glamorous space for weddings and group events.
Rooms range in size from the modest Medallion Suite at 434 square-feet, to the 1,428 square-foot Venus Suite, which features two private balconies with a view of Ocean Drive—all overlooking the mosaic swimming pool. The former designer’s bedroom, The Villa Suite, is 1,174 square-feet with a nine-foot double king-size bed that may be big enough for the whole family to pile into.
Guests can enjoy private spa services in their rooms and dine at the newly opened Il Sole, an intimate 30-seat restaurant.
Although the Versace family has not owned the mansion since 2000, its legendary style has been preserved over the years. Gianni Versace bought the mansion in 1992 and spent $33 million in renovations. In 1997, he was shot dead on its front steps by spree killer Andrew Cunanan. Although the private property was officially renamed Casa Casuarina, locals still call the mansion by its most famous owner’s name.
Last September the mansion was acquired by VM South Beach in a contentious real-estate bidding war.
The new luxury Villa by Barton G. is expected to be open for business by the end of March, according the The Daily Mail. Suites start at $795 per night with the Villa Suite going from $2,200 per night.
