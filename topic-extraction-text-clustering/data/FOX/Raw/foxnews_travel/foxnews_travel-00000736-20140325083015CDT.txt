For some, a Vegas trip means planning a party for every hour of the visit

New York is known as the city that never sleeps, but in Las Vegas just about anything you desire is available 24 hours a day. 
From dining to dancing, resorts are offering more services and attractions around the clock, and tourists, who cram activities into every hour of the visit, seem to be taking advantage of it.
“We really enjoy trying to squeeze everything we possibly can in,” said Denise Cassidy of New York, who admits she doesn’t sleep while in Sin City.
“You can pretty much find whatever it is that you need, 24 hours,” tourist Giovanna Gonzalez said.
Instead of meeting for a typical breakfast, guests can dress to impress well before noon for boozy brunches or wild parties by the pool. Some of the hottest events are Encore Beach Club, Daylight at Mandalay Bay, DITCH Fridays at Palms Pool--with fees as much as $50 just to get in.
After the day partying ends, guests can head back to the hotel to change for the evening.  Dinner options abound and the overnight hours can be spent at one of Vegas’ world-class dance clubs, such as XS nightclub at Encore, the Marquee at The Cosmopolitan and Tao at The Venetian, that stay open until after the sunrise.
“From the moment they arrive they squeeze every moment out of that trip even during the overnight hours,” said Christopher Joy, vice president of operations at the Palms Hotel.
If you get the late night munchies after all that partying, there’s no need to blow your diet on a cheeseburger and fries. There are now plenty of fine dining restaurants open around the clock.
“I want to eat healthy,” said visitor Tracy Thomas from Pittsburgh, who brought her family to Central at Caesar’s Palace for a late night meal. “At midnight, I’m going to feel a lot better eating Sea Bass and then waking up at 7 o’clock in the morning.
And don’t worry about an early check out the next day.  At the Palms Casino Resort, guests who book directly through the hotel can stay in their rooms a full 24 hours, regardless of when they checked in.  Say goodbye to only getting access to your room at 2 p.m. and checking out the next day at noon.
“I wish Disneyland was open 24 hours so I can do the rides all night long and eat all night long but unfortunately it’s not Las Vegas,” Gonzalez said.
