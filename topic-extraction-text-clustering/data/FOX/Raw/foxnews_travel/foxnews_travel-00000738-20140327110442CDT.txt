A couple wants an apology after an insensitive message was left on their luggage.
A deaf Houston couple is demanding an apology from American Airlines after discovering an insensitive note attached to their lost luggage from a Hawaiian vacation.
Angela Huckaby and James Moehle told ABC’s KRTK someone wrote “Please text.  Deaf and dumb,” on their lost luggage so the couple could be reunited with their bags.
Huckaby and Moehle, a successful tradesman, said they were offended. 
"It was just outrageous and cruel and unnecessary," said Moehle's mother, Kay Moehle, told KRTK. “That person needs to be fired.”
They have written a letter to American Airlines asking for an apology and disciplinary action.
In a statement, the airline said it was investigating:
"We apologize to Mr. Moehle and Ms. Huckaby. It was clearly a very poor choice of words. We're confident there was no ill will, but we'll be looking into this further and will be following up with our team members at IAH and the contractor that provides our baggage delivery services."
